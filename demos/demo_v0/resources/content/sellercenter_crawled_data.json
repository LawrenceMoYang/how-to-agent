It’s free to list. You’ll only pay a fee if your item sells.\nFor most casual sellers, it’s free to list on eBay. If you list more than 250 items per month, you’ll start paying a $0.35 insertion fee per listing. Category exclusions apply.\nIf your item sells, eBay keeps a portion of the sale. This final value fee is 13.25% or lower depending on the category, plus a per order fee. For orders $10.00 or less the per order fee is $0.30, for orders over $10.00 the per order fee is $0.40\nWhen am I charged fees?\nThe costs to sell on eBay are broken down into two phases:\nGive your listings a boost\nLooking to give your listings an edge? For additional fees, you can opt into features that help your items stand out and attract more buyers.\nHelp your items stand out among billions of listings on eBay and increase the likelihood of a sale through Promoted Listings. The best part? You only pay an ad fee if your item sells.\nWhen creating your listing, you can select upgrades like subtitles or setting an auction reserve price. These features incur an additional fee that will be charged whether or not your item sells.\nCalculate your fees\nThe fees you pay depend on the number of listings you have, the product category of the item you’re selling, and whether you have an eBay Store Subscription. Using the chart below, you can compare standard selling fees with the discounted rates that come with a Store subscription. Excludes Starter Stores .\nInsertion fees\nCategory restrictions apply.

Learn more about Store benefits and subscriptions.\nFAQs\nWhere can I find a breakdown and explanation of the fees I have been charged?\nAn itemized list of all your selling transactions and associated fees can be viewed under the “Payments” tab in Seller Hub or My eBay.\nTip: You can view fees by clicking the “Fees” filter button located above your list of transactions. Go to the Payments tab in Seller Hub or Payments in My eBay .\nWhat are “international fees”?\nIf your registered address is in the U.S., we charge an international fee if either:\nThe delivery address for the item (entered by the buyer during checkout) is outside the U.S.; OR if\nThe buyer’s registered address is outside the U.S. (regardless of the delivery address for the item). Learn more .\nWhat are the fees for selling vehicles on eBay?\nThe fees for listing and selling a vehicle on eBay Motors are different from the fees for listing and selling in other categories. See fee details here .\nWhen will I be charged selling fees?\nInsertion fees, including optional listing upgrades fees, are charged at the time your item is listed. Sellers get up to 250 zero insertion fee listings each month; so, if you have fewer than 250 live listings and do not want any optional upgrades for your listing, you won’t be charged any insertion fees when you create a listing. If you do elect to upgrade your listings, those upgrade fees will be charged at time of listing, regardless of whether your item sells.\nFinal value fees, meanwhile, are charged once your item sells. If your item doesn’t sell, you will not be charged any final value fees.\nHow am I billed for selling fees?\nFees and expenses such as those arising from refunds, claims or disputes, are deducted directly from your earnings. If your earnings are not sufficient to cover these amounts we will charge your payment method on file (debit or credit card, and/or linked bank account) within 14 days. Learn more .\nIf I set a reserve price for my auction listing, will I be charged a reserve fee if my item doesn’t sell?\nYes. You can set a reserve price on an auction-style listing that is the minimum bid price that must be met for your item to sell. Reserve prices are an optional listing upgrade, which will incur a fee when you create your listing whether or not your item sells. Reserve fees are calculated at $5 or 7.5% of the reserve price you set, whichever is greater, up to a maximum fee of $250.\nTip: If you’re nervous about selling an item for less money than you want without a reserve price, start your auction-style or fixed-price listing at a price you are comfortable with and select the ‘Allow Offers’ setting on your listing. This enables buyers to submit offers, which you can accept, decline, or counter-offer. Best of all, the ‘Allow Offers’ feature is available for free, so you can avoid incurring a fee for a listing that doesn’t sell. Learn more .\nHow are final value fees calculated?\nWe charge one final value fee when your item sells. This fee is calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale — including the cost of the item and shipping, sales tax, and other applicable fees — plus the per order fee.

        "content": "Provide great customer service\nLearn some essential tips for providing your buyers with the best possible customer service you can offer.\nCustomer service tips\nOne of the most effective ways to ensure that your customers keep coming back is to give them a satisfactory buying experience. Here are some tips to get you started.\n1. Let buyers know when their purchase will arrive\nBeing informed about the status of their order is one of the most important aspects of a buyers’ online shopping experience. Informed buyers are also less likely to make an “item not received” claim.\nKeep your buyers happy by:\nSetting accurate handling times . The handling time you set for each listing is a commitment to buyers to get orders to your shipping carrier on time. It’s important to stick to your handling time and to set handling times you know you can make. You may wish to adjust your handling time during busy seasons or popular promotions.\nSetting accurate handling times . The handling time you set for each listing is a commitment to buyers to get orders to your shipping carrier on time. It’s important to stick to your handling time and to set handling times you know you can make. You may wish to adjust your handling time during busy seasons or popular promotions.\nUploading tracking information . You are required to upload integrated tracking in the structured data field before the estimated delivery date has passed in order to appeal an “item not received” claim. eBay will not protect you from a claim if you send the tracking number to the buyer via email. Without tracking information, eBay can’t protect you because we won’t be able to confirm your item was delivered. eBay labels uploads tracking automatically. Some shipping services don’t add or integrate tracking at all, and manually uploading tracking can lead to errors.\nUploading tracking information .

Some shipping services don’t add or integrate tracking at all, and manually uploading tracking can lead to errors.\n2. Offer a generous returns policy\nShoppers are more likely to buy an item when they’re confident that it can be returned if necessary. That’s why offering a generous return policy makes good business sense.\nLearn how a strong policy can give you an edge over other sellers. It’s easier than you might think and well worth the effort. For example, you can now automatically approve certain kinds of returns or issue refunds. That way you can keep business moving without interruption.\n3. Create clear and accurate listings\nWrite a clear description and include well-shot photos, that way your buyers have a good idea about what they’re ordering. If your buyer knows what to expect from their order, they’re less likely to be dissatisfied when they receive it.\nLearn to create listings that sell and satisfy customers.\n4. Avoid unpaid items\nIf you don’t already, you should require immediate payment for both fixed-price and auction-style listings with a Buy It Now option. Resolving payments immediately helps to avoid possible disputes with your buyer down the road.\nLearn more about resolving unpaid items , including how to automatically cancel an order if a buyer doesn’t pay within the allotted time.\n5. Manage your buyers’ requests and disputes\nYou can view your buyers’ refunds, returns, “Item not received” and “Item not as described” requests, and payment disputes in the Orders tab on Seller Hub or in My eBay . Keeping on top of these requests and disputes helps keep your buyers satisfied, increasing the chances that they’ll become return customers."

We’ve simplified our policies so that they are easy to understand and follow. That way, if you do come across an issue , you’ll know exactly what you need to do to avoid any disruptions to your account.\nIf you have a policy issue, we’ll help you fix it\nIf a listing gets flagged for a potential policy issue, we’ll give you an opportunity to correct the issue and avoid disruptions to your account. We’ll clearly communicate the issue and advise specific actions you’ll need to take to correct it. We understand that inadvertent mistakes can happen, and if they do, we’ll help you fix them.\nContinue selling while you correct an issue\nRather than end all of your listings or suspend your account, our “Hide All Listings” enforcement measure temporarily hides all of your listings from buyers’ eBay search and browsing results until you correct a policy issue. Watchers, bidders, or buyers will still be able to do business with you. After you correct the issue, all of your listings will be visible again, and you won’t lose any of your items’ sale history.\nExclusive protections for Top Rated Sellers\nWe protect all sellers from abusive buying behavior and from events outside their control.

This is why Top Rated Sellers who reside in the US and list on eBay.com receive additional protection benefits when they offer 30-day-or-longer returns.\nReturn shipping label credit for false “item not as described” claims\nIf a buyer falsely claims an item was “not as described,” we’ll protect you on eligible transactions. We’ll reimburse your return shipping label cost up to $6 per return.

If there are any issues with buyers that may negatively impact you, we’ll take care of them by removing any negative and neutral feedback, defects, and open cases in service metrics.\nFAQs\nHow do I appeal a case?\nIf a case is closed in the buyer’s favor, you can appeal the decision by providing the appropriate documentation—including any new information or communication between you and the buyer—to the eBay Resolution Center within 30 days from the day the case is closed. If the decision is reversed, your final value fee will be refunded. Additionally, any defects for the transaction will be automatically removed.\nI sold an item but the buyer hasn’t paid. What should I do?\nIf you haven’t been paid for an item you sold, start by communicating directly with the buyer via Messages in My eBay . This will provide a documentation trail in case the issue is ever escalated to eBay.\nIf you can’t work things out with the buyer, you can cancel the transaction.\nReturns FAQs\nWhen will a return no longer result in a defect?\nSellers will only receive a returns-related defect if eBay has to help resolve a returns issue, and the resolution is in favor of the buyer. The buyer’s reason for returning an item will no longer count as a defect as long as you successfully resolve a return request with the buyer without asking eBay for help.\nWhen should I ask eBay to help after the sale?\nAlways try to work out all issues with your buyer. If you cannot resolve the issue, ask eBay to step in and help. If eBay finds on behalf of the buyer, you could receive a defect.\nCan I dispute paying for return shipping if I feel a buyer is misusing returns?\nYou can ask eBay to step in and help if you feel the buyer has misrepresented the reason for the return. eBay will review your request and take appropriate action. Remember, when you ask eBay to step in and help without successfully resolving the issue directly with your buyer and eBay finds on behalf of the buyer, it will result in a defect.\nWhat happens if I can’t resolve an issue with my buyer but they don’t ask eBay for help?\nAs long as neither you nor your buyer asks eBay to intervene, the return will time out after 30 days and there will be no impact to your seller standing.\nWhat should I do if there is a problem with the item condition after the buyer sends it back?\nYou can offer a partial refund. Check the item condition policy for more information.\nTop Rated Seller FAQs\nIf I am not a Top Rated Seller, how does eBay protect me?\nWhen you deliver on your service promise to provide a great buying experience, you are protected from abusive buying activity and events outside your control. Protections include removing feedback, defects and open claims from Service Metrics.\nWhy do Top Rated Sellers receive additional protections?\nWhen things go wrong, your track record matters. Top Rated Sellers consistently deliver great buyer experiences and meet the highest standards for selling on eBay. This track record of delivering great buyer experiences allows us to deliver a higher level of protections.\nHow can I qualify as a Top Rated Seller?\nTo become a Top Rated Seller , you must satisfy these requirements:\nMaintain an active eBay account for at least 90 days\nComplete 100 or more transactions and $1,000 in sales during the previous 12 months with US buyers\nHave a defect rate less than or equal to 0.5%\nClose cases without seller resolution less than or equal to 0.3%\nHave a late shipment rate less than or equal to 3%\nUpload tracking within your stated handling time, and show carrier validation for 95% of transactions to US buyers\nOnce you meet these requirements, we automatically upgrade you to the Top Rated Seller status at your next evaluation.\nWhat should I do if I receive a false “item not as described” claim?\nTop Rated Sellers who offer 30-day-or-longer returns will receive a return shipping label subsidy for “item not as described” claims on eligible transactions.

We’ll then give you a grace period to take all the actions you’ll need to resolve the issue.\nIf an item cannot be sold on eBay because it is prohibited, we will remove the item to protect you and refund your fees.\nIf you relist the item after we remove it, or don’t take steps to correct the issue, all of your listings may be hidden from new buyers for a brief period.\nWhat will happen if my listings are hidden?\nAll of your fixed price listings will be temporarily hidden in search results and browsing, resulting in new buyers not being able to find them on eBay. However, any watchers, auction bidders, or active buyers will be able to continue to do business with you in My eBay. You can still ship orders, leave and receive feedback, and resolve any buyer problems.\nAfter this temporary period, your items will automatically return to eBay search with their search history intact so new buyers can find them. While your listings are hidden from buyers’ search results and browsing, you may still edit them as needed to comply with the applicable policy. Keep in mind that as a seller you’re still responsible for all required fees.\nHow will I know what to do to comply with a policy?\nIf we flag a potential policy issue, we’ll notify you through email and My eBay messages of the activity that isn’t following the policy and the steps you will need to take to comply with the policy. We understand that inadvertent mistakes can happen. And if they do, we’ll help you fix them."

If you’d like to manage your own fitment, you can learn more about how to use the Fitment Plus toolkit by visiting our Help page .\nFAQs\nWhat is fitment, and is it the same as compatibility?\nThe terms fitment and compatibility are often used interchangeably as they have similar meanings. “Fitment” is a term common in the automotive industry to refer to vehicles that a part is made to fit, while “compatibility” has a wider meaning across other categories outside of parts and accessories.\nI already have compatibility information on my listings; how can Fitment Plus benefit me?\nFitment Plus is a tool that can help you find and add complete, accurate, and updated compatibility information (also known as fitment) to your listings. If your listings already have some fitment, there may be more information available that you can add through Fitment Plus to help make your listings seen more by buyers. Even if you’ve used the tool before, our catalog may have grown and has the ability to add additional compatibility information.\nWhen I go to create an account the link takes me to myfitment.com. Is this site one eBay recommends?\nYes. eBay acquired myFitment in 2022 and is offering free fitment services, as Fitment Plus, to eBay sellers.\nWhat is Automatic Fitment Coverage?\nThis free service is designed to automatically keep your listings up-to-date with the latest fitment. Automatic updates are applied based on your fitment coverage preferences. This service is only available for eBay Fitment Plus subscribers.\nWhat is the benefit of using Automatic Fitment Coverage?\nWith Automatic Fitment Coverage, your listings continue to benefit from accurate fitment data without the need for manual updates. Fitment information is automatically updated according to your specified coverage preferences, saving you time and effort.\nI have multiple eBay stores. Can I still get automatic fitment updates?\nYes, the sign-up process is quick and simple:\n1. Log in to your Fitment Plus account\n2. Click \"Get automatic fitment coverage for this store\" on your home view\n3. Confirm the store that will receive automatic fitment updates\n4. Define desired fitment coverage preferences for your selected store\nHow can I set up rules to automate updates for my listings?\nYou can manage the automatic publishing settings on myFitment.com under Profile / Automatic Fitment Coverage Preferences. The same setting options for publishing fitment manually are available when setting up automatic updates for your listings.\nCan I opt out of the automatic update service?\nYes, you can opt out at any time to stop automatic fitment updates. All previous fitment updates will still apply to the listings, so nothing will be lost if you choose to pause or stop the automatic updates. There may be a delay of up to 2 business days between the request to opt out and the end of the service.\nDoes participation or cancellation of Automatic Fitment Coverage impact my Fitment Plus subscription?\nNo. This is a free add-on service to Fitment Plus, and it’s designed to make it easy to maximize your fitment coverage. If you decide to manually update your listings, you will still have access to the value that Fitment Plus provides.\nWho is responsible for the fitment that is added to my listings as part of Automated Fitment Coverage?\nSellers are always responsible for the fitment associated with their listings and we encourage you to regularly review fitment to ensure it’s to your satisfaction. We suggest using myFitment’s tools to research and publish fitment manually to build confidence and familiarity, before signing up for automatic updates. You can adjust or cancel your level of participation at any point.\nHow long does it take for new compatibility to appear on my listings?\nYou should see your new compatibility information on your listings within the same day of publishing. If you use a third party tool to manage your listings, you may need to take action within the third party tool before your listings are updated. For more information review our Help page .\nAre there limitations on which listings Fitment Plus can update?\nFitment Plus can update any listings in the parts and accessories categories that allow fitment, as long as there is no temporary restriction on the listing (such as a current offer). For listings in categories that don’t allow fitment, Fitment Plus can suggest a new category if there is fitment available. Additionally, listings in an ‘offer’ status as well as listings whose fitment was added through the eBay parts catalog (i.e. they have an eBay Product identifier (ePID)) can’t be updated.\nHow often should I check for compatibility updates?\nWe suggest checking for updates monthly or every time you add new listings. Alternatively, you can set your preferences for Automatic Fitment Coverage and we’ll make sure your listings have updated fitment.\nCan I use Fitment Plus to only add new compatibility, or will it replace all of my current data?\nYou can select whether you want to add  new compatibility to new listings or replace all existing compatibility in all listings."

The Great Price badge is not a paid feature and you don’t need to opt in to qualify.\nGreat Price badge eligibility\nEligibility for a Great Price badge is determined by a combination of factors, such as:\nSeller performance. Sellers must be in good standing with Above Standard or Top Rated status. If you’re new to eBay, you can begin working toward eBay Above Standard and Top Rated status the first time you list an item .\nCompetitive pricing. Use Terapeak , our exclusive eBay insights tool in the Seller Hub Research tab, to get competitive insights and price your items accordingly.

Your login credentials and other private information are secure and won’t be shared with any users you invite through MUAA.\nImprove your productivity by delegating specific workflows to others\nGain additional support without exposing your password and critical business information to designated users\nAuthorized users, depending on their permissions, may also contact customer support on your behalf to resolve potential issues\nLearn more about this feature in the multi-user account access FAQ.\nHow does multi-user account access work?\nThe account owner grants an authorized user permissions to access and perform workflows, which the authorized user agrees to perform on the account owner’s behalf. Authorized users must perform these functions using their own eBay accounts with their own passwords.\nThe account owner sets the permissions and “invites” the authorized user to perform the assigned functions. After an authorized user accepts the account owner’s invitation, they can perform the assigned functions. Both account owner and authorized user manage their multi-user account access invitations and permissions on the My eBay Account Settings page.\nHow can I start using multi-user account access?\nYou must be opted-in to Seller Hub to allow another user access to your account. If you are not yet opted-in, you can opt in here . After you opt in, you can grant permissions to another user to act on your behalf. Go to My eBay > Summary > Account, and click Permissions under My Account to invite your users and grant them permissions.\nWith multi-user account access (MUAA), you can grant other eBay users access to your account by sending invites from the Account Permissions page in My eBay.\nInvite a user to access your account and grant them permission to “Create and edit drafts.”\nTo grant access, enter the authorized user’s name and email address. We strongly recommend that an authorized user keeps a separate eBay account to perform workflows on your behalf, distinct from a personal eBay account they may be using to buy and sell on eBay. This will help avoid potential confusion about the account they are using. After you select the permissions you want to grant to the authorized user, click “Add user.” The authorized user will receive an email invitation, accept it, and have access to your Listings tab in Seller Hub.\nIf the authorized user has an eBay account with the same email address, they will be taken to the eBay sign-in page when they accept your invitation. If the authorized user does not have an account with that email address, they will be taken to the Registration flow to create a new account with that email address.\nOnce signed in, the authorized user will have access to the account owner’s Listings tab in Seller Hub to perform the functions granted to them. They will not have access to any other parts of the account owner’s Seller Hub content.\nLearn more\nYou’ll need to be opted in to Seller Hub so that, once invited, other users can manage aspects of your account.\nIf the person you wish to grant access to doesn’t have an eBay account, they’ll need to create an account first.\nYou can choose to grant any of the following selling permissions:\nCreate and edit listing drafts\nPublish and revise listings\nResearch products using Terapeak ( Subscription required )\nView orders\nDownload order report\nAdd shipping tracking number\nPrint shipping labels\nOnce you’ve selected the permissions you wish to grant to another eBay member, they can only act on your behalf while in Seller Hub, and can only perform the tasks you’ve given them permission for.\nTip : Your password and any other personal details associated with your account are secure and won’t be shared with the accounts you invite through MUAA.\nManaging your multi-user account access invitations and permissions\nYou can manage your multi-user account access (MUAA) invitations and permissions from the Account Permissions page in My eBay.\nGo to Account Permissions\nFrom this page under Action you can do the following:\nView a list of all accounts you’ve sent invitations to Invitations that haven’t been accepted will show as pending and will expire after 24 hours\nInvitations that haven’t been accepted will show as pending and will expire after 24 hours\nRevoke an invitation if you’ve accidentally invited the wrong person\nChange or remove permission from an account\nFAQs\nWho can authorize access to other users to access and perform basic listing functions in their account?\nSellers who have opted into Seller Hub can authorize other users to perform functions on your behalf.\nWho can be an authorized user?\nNew or existing users with a US eBay account can be authorized users. After you accept an invitation as an authorized user, you cannot authorize access with the same account.\nHow many authorized users can an account owner invite?\nThere is no limit to the number of authorized users that can act on your behalf. We recommend adding no more than 10 authorized users to your account to ensure a manageable process.\nAs an authorized user, how many invitations can I accept from an account owner?\nThere is no limit to the number of invitations from account owners that you can accept.\nAs an account owner, what if the person I want to invite to act on my behalf does not have an eBay account?\nAuthorized users can be existing eBay members or become new eBay members when they complete the Registration flow after they accept the invitation. If the email address you invite is not associated with an eBay account, that person will be taken through the Registration flow. If the email address you invite is already associated with an eBay account, that member will be taken to the eBay sign-in page when they accept the invitation.\nWhat if I mistype an email address in my invitation?\nInvitations automatically expire after 24 hours if not accepted. If you believe the wrong person received and accepted an invitation you sent, you can revoke the invitation on your My eBay Authorized users page.\nWhat parts of the eBay site work with multi-user account access?\nAs an authorized user, you can only act on behalf of an account owner in their Seller Hub .\nAs an authorized user, how do I switch accounts?\nIf you need to switch to another account as an authorized user you can select Switch account in the blue banner across the top of the page in Seller Hub. Learn more about switching accounts from Seller Hub or My eBay.\nAs an authorized user, can I contact eBay customer support?\nIf you call customer support, please let the representative know that you are using the Multi-User Account Access feature, and which account you were acting on behalf of."

        "content": "Verified Rights Owner Program\nProtect your IP rights and make sure you’re compliant.\nWhat is the Verified Rights Owner Program?\nThe Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program allows owners of intellectual property (IP) rights and their authorized representatives to report eBay listings that may infringe on those rights. VeRO embodies our commitment to provide a safe place to buy and sell, which respects property owners’ rights.\nMore information\nWhat happened to my listing?\nIf your listing was removed based on a VeRO report, eBay sent you an email with details about why your listing was reported and how to contact the rights owner directly for more information. If you have concerns or questions about why your listing was removed, please contact the rights owner directly.\nContact us in the following circumstances\nYou can’t find the rights owner’s email address in your removal notification email.\nYou emailed the rights owner, but they haven’t replied after 5 business days.\nSellers are responsible for ensuring that any item they list on eBay is authentic and that the listing description doesn’t infringe on the rights of others.\nExamples of infringements\nItems that bear the rights owner’s trademark—such as a logo—but were not authorized by the rights owner.\nUnauthorized copies of audio, video, or other media.\nUnauthorized use of a rights owner’s images or text in a listing.\nVeRO participant profiles\n3\n6\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nZ\nSeller FAQs\nWhat are some reasons my listing may have been reported?\nTrademark infringement A trademark is a unique sign (such as a name, word, phrase, logo, or symbol) that a company uses to identify its products or services. For example, eBay is the name of our company, but it’s also a trademark used on our site and on various eBay products. Trademark laws are primarily designed to protect consumers from confusing one company’s goods or services with those of another.\nReplica and counterfeit It’s illegal to sell counterfeits, fakes, or replicas of brand-name items. We don’t allow these items to be sold on eBay.\nExample\nItems that weren’t made by the manufacturer but the items are labeled with the brand, like a purse that has a Burberry label on it but wasn’t made by Burberry.\nBrand name misuse You may not use brand names in your listing if the product isn’t manufactured by or compatible with that brand. You may use \"compatible with,\" \"fits,\" or \"for\" before a brand name if the item you are describing is specifically designed to be compatible with the products of that brand.\nExamples\nA generic case made for an iPhone uses the brand name \"Apple\".\nListing an adidas shoe and adding the brand name \"Nike\".\nLogo misuse If you include logos in your listing descriptions, make sure you’re authorized to use them. Using someone’s logo without permission is a violation of trademark laws and can be misleading for buyers. Creating a logo that's similar to someone else’s can also be a trademark infringement.\nExample\nListing a branded item and including logos in your description or images without authorization.\nWarranty Listings that contain a misrepresentation regarding an item’s warranty are in violation of trademark laws. Information relating to the warranty of a product is considered material information and should never be misrepresented. You should read the warranty or contact the manufacturer to be sure that the warranty is eligible for a buyer before mentioning it in a listing.\nExample\nListing a product and including information about the manufacturer's warranty without checking to see if it covers resale of the product.\nCopyright infringements A copyright is the legal protection given to authors of creative works such as movies, music, software, photographs, and books, both published and unpublished. Copyright protection prevents others from using the work without permission.\nImage and text Using someone else’s image or description without permission could violate copyright laws. If you use text or an image that was created by someone else be sure that you have permission to use the text or image.\nExamples\nImages or text copied from other websites or internet searches.\nStock photos and text used without permission.\nScans or text copied from catalogs or advertisements.\nMedia, software, movies, paintings Selling unauthorized copies of media, software, movies, or paintings violates copyright laws. Unauthorized copies include but aren’t limited to backup, pirated, duplicated, or bootlegged copies. Copyright protection prevents others from using creative works without permission. It may also limit the right to distribute the copyrighted product.\nExamples\nBurning unauthorized copies of movies or music and selling the copies.\nOpened software subject to licensing agreements.\nCD-Rs or DVD-Rs that include multiple copies of books or images.\nDesign right (Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand only) Design right applies to the way something looks, the shape and configuration of a product, but not its functionality. Design rights protect designs from being copied and used by someone else.\nExample\nThe shape and material used to create a designer sofa is copied and used to create an imitation or lookalike.\nPatent rights (Europe) A patent is a specific set of rights granted to inventors, giving them the right to exclude others from making, using, and selling their invention. Patents are registered with each region’s patent and trademark office.\nParallel imports Some products are intended for sale in a specific market or country. The sale of these products into another country or market could violate trademark or copyright laws. We strongly encourage our members to educate themselves about the laws of their own country, as well as the countries where they plan to do business.\nExample\nProduct intended for sale only in the United States is listed for sale to buyers in Europe.\nHow can I create legally compliant listings?\nCreate your own listing content Write your own text for your listing and take your own photos. Don’t use text or images from other web searches, manufacturer websites, third-party product catalogs, or other sources without specific permission from the owner of the content.\nUse the eBay Product Catalog to create your listing If you’re creating a listing that has been added to the eBay product catalog, you can take advantage of images and product details that are already available.\nMake sure the statements in your listing are accurate Make sure that all statements and claims in your listing are accurate and complete. Rights owners may object to listings that contain false, inaccurate, or misleading claims about their brands or products.\nUse brand names appropriately If you’re selling a brand-name product, you can mention the brand name in your listing and include photos that you’ve taken of the item you’re selling. However, don’t suggest that you’re an authorized dealer/reseller if you’re not.\nReview the VeRO participant profiles created by intellectual property rights owners We encourage intellectual property rights owners who report items through the VeRO program to create a participant profile that explains their policies and procedures concerning infringing items. If you have questions or concerns about a specific item you’re interested in selling, check the VeRO Participant Profiles tab on this page to find the profiles created by rights owners.\nWhat happens if I have more than one VeRO violation?\nSellers who continue to violate intellectual property rights may be subject to a range of consequences, from selling restrictions to full suspension from the site.\nWhy was my listing removed when there are other listings just like it?\nYou may see items on eBay that are similar to your listing but haven’t been removed. There are a few reasons why this could happen\nThere might be a difference between your listing and the other that isn’t obvious.\nAn intellectual property rights owner may have reported your listing as allegedly infringing, but hasn’t yet reported the other listings.\nIf you see another listing that you think violates the rights of the owner, please email the rights owner.\nWill my fees be refunded?\nIf we removed your listing because of a policy violation, we may refund your fees for that listing, depending on the policy you violated and whether you’ve violated our policies in the past.\nWhat if I think the rights owner made a mistake in reporting my listing?\nIf your listing was reported and you believe your listing was removed in error, contact the rights owner directly. The email we sent you about the removal will include the rights owner’s contact information. If the rights owner has made a mistake, they should email eBay to retract their report.\nHow can I file a counter notice? (US only)\nCounter notices can only be submitted for US-based copyright reports, in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Find out what information you need to provide when filing a counter notice as outlined under 17 U.S.C. section 512(g)(3). Once we receive a valid counter notice, we’ll provide a copy of the notice to the VeRO participant and inform them that the listings will be reinstated after 10 business days if they don’t inform us that they have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from relisting the items. If you wish to file a counter notice, you can contact us.\nDid you share my account information?\neBay may disclose your personal information to other members of the eBay Inc. corporate family or to third parties, as outlined in our User Privacy Notice .\nCan I relist my item?\nIf your listing was removed, don’t relist without first finding out why.\nIf your listing was removed due to the way it was described (in image or text), you can edit your listing to remove the content in question and relist.\nRelisting an allegedly counterfeit item that has been reported through VeRO could result in a range of consequences including, but not limited to, selling restrictions or suspension from eBay. For this reason, the Relist option isn’t available for items reported as allegedly counterfeit.\nCan eBay verify my item?\nNo. eBay isn’t an expert in the intellectual property rights of third parties. As a result, we aren’t in a position to make a judgment as to whether the item you have listed is authorized or legal. This is why we urge you to contact the rights owner directly.\nI want to contact a rights owner. What should I do?\nWhen we removed your listing(s), we sent you a message in My Messages which contains the name of the rights owner and their contact information. We encourage you to contact them if you feel your item was removed incorrectly or if you need additional information about why it was reported and removed. If the rights owner has a VeRO participant profile, please read it first as it may answer some of the questions you have. Be sure to include the following information when you contact the rights owner\nYour eBay user ID.\nYour eBay email address.\nThe listing number(s) that were removed.\nImages of your product where possible.\nWhy didn’t eBay contact me before removing my listing?\nWhen eBay receives notice through VeRO that a listing allegedly infringes intellectual property rights, we must remove the listing as soon as possible. Resource constraints prevent us from contacting users prior to removal of allegedly infringing items and/or content from our site.\nI bought this item on eBay. Why wasn’t it removed then?\nUnfortunately, there may be times when listings aren’t removed because the rights owner has not reported them to us. If you believe an item is potentially infringing, and it hasn’t been removed by eBay, we encourage you to contact the rights owner and inform them of the possible infringement.\nA rights owner is just trying to eliminate competition. Why does eBay trust rights owners more than sellers?\nVeRO may only be used by rights owners to submit claims of alleged intellectual property infringement. eBay doesn't accept reports from rights owners alleging violations of selective distribution agreements, MAP policies, or other contractual agreements.\nRights owner FAQs\nHow can I retract a report I made?\nIf you’ve reported a listing in error, you can submit a retraction by emailing the listing information to the VeRO team at vero@ebay.com .\nWhat if I don’t own intellectual property?\nSince the VeRO program is for rights owners, if you don’t own intellectual property rights and aren’t their authorized representative, you won’t be able to report items through the program.\nHowever, you can still help by getting in touch with legitimate rights owners (companies or individuals who hold intellectual property rights) and encouraging them to contact us about participating in the VeRO program. You can also inform them of potentially problematic listings.\nCan I use VeRO to report stolen items?\nThe VeRO program can’t be used to report stolen items. If you have identified a seller listing items which you believe to be stolen, we ask that you contact the relevant law enforcement body. We can’t take action regarding stolen items unless we receive a report from law enforcement . Once this happens, we’ll gladly assist them with their investigations."

They may include brand, size, length, width, height, type, color, or style, and vary depending on what you’re selling.\nTogether with product identifiers , item specifics are the most important way to help buyers find what they’re looking for. Buyers use item specifics to filter their search results, and your item will only appear in those filtered search results if you’ve added the matching item specific. The more item specifics you complete, the better eBay can match your item to what a buyer is looking for.\nBenefits of item specifics\nItem specifics provide you with a number of benefits, including:\nImprove the visibility of your listings in search results\nImprove the visibility of your listings in search results\nIncrease your chances of being found on eBay, Google Shopping, and external search results\nIncrease your chances of being found on eBay, Google Shopping, and external search results\nIncrease the chances of buyers finding your listings when they filter search results, especially on mobile devices\nIncrease the chances of buyers finding your listings when they filter search results, especially on mobile devices\nItem specifics requirements and recommendations\neBay uses certain labels to indicate which specifics will help your items get found more easily by buyers:\nRequired\nCertain item specifics are critical in identifying your items and making sure your buyers can shop with confidence. You’ll need to fill in all Required item specifics for any new or revised listing. See the latest item specifics requirements for your categories.\nRequired Soon\nWe periodically add new Required item specifics based on buyers’ search trends. If your listings have item specifics that will be Required Soon, you’ll see a note as you list that you can hover over to learn when they will become required. You can also check the latest item specifics requirements to learn about what’s upcoming for the categories you regularly list in.\nRecommended\nWe recommend certain item specifics based on buyer demand data and popular searches. Add as many of these as you can to help buyers find your listings.\nAdditional\nThese item specifics help buyers know more about your item. Completing these could potentially save you from having to answer questions about your item, and help you make a sale.\nWhen creating a listing, these labels will help you identify the most important item specifics to fill out first.\nTip: The lightning bolt meter (outlined in yellow) will fill up to indicate how complete your item specifics are.\nFeatures for finding missing item specifics\nThere are a number of features to assist you in adding missing item specifics to your listings.\nView missing item specifics in Seller Hub tasks\nOn your Overview page in Seller Hub, a new task in the Tasks module will let you know when you have listings that are missing required item specifics. Simply click on the task and you’ll be taken to those listings.\nItem specifics Quick Filters\nIf any of your listings are missing Required, Required Soon, or Recommended item specifics, you’ll see a corresponding Quick Filter on your Seller Hub Active Listings page.\nAdd item specifics from Active Listings\nFrom your Active Listings page, you can select multiple listings and click “Add item specifics.”  This will load all of your selected listings into a pop-up window where you can cycle through each listing and add any missing item specifics.\nRequired Soon feature\nWhen you list or revise an item, you’ll see “Required soon” above any item specifics that have an upcoming enforcement date. Seller Hub will show you more information as well as the dates the item specific will become mandatory for your current listing.\nItem specifics rankings\nAs you list, you’ll see guidance on what item specifics your buyers are searching for, based on the number of searches over the past 30 days.

Learn more about how to use Download/Upload file .\nOptiseller Aspect Finder+\nOptiseller Aspect Finder+ is a third-party tool that can help you quickly identify and update listings that are missing item specifics.*\nListings with multiple variations\nAdding variations to your listings lets you use item specifics to group closely related items under a single listing.\nFor example, if you’re selling shoes, you can create a single listing with multiple variations for different sizes.\nItems grouped under a single listing need to be closely related, and you can select from a list of variation details (such as size, color, or width) to describe how they are related.\nAs part of our item specifics updates, certain variation details will no longer be valid. This change helps clarify what variations work best as a single listing, and what items are more likely to get noticed as separate listings.\nListings impacted by this change will display the following error message when you edit them: “This attribute is not valid for this variation. Add a valid attribute.”\nIf you see this message, first try to update your listing. Look for an existing variation detail that more accurately describes how the items are related. For example, a listing for a kitchen faucet may have previously used “Type” to describe the variations “Stainless steel”, “Rubbed Bronze”, and “Chrome.” This could be updated to “Finish.”\nIf you can’t find a relevant existing variation detail, you’ll need to create separate listings. For example, a listing for tools may have used “Type” to describe variations for “Hammer,” “Wrench,” and “Screwdriver.” In this case, the items are not closely related enough to fall under a single listing. The variation “Type” will need to be removed and the items re-listed separately.\nMaking these changes helps your listings with multiple variations show up in the right searches, and encourages buyers to feel more confident with their purchase.\nPersonalize with eBay\nPersonalizing items for your buyers is now easier with our new item specific feature. This feature allows you to easily communicate to the buyer what information you will need from them to personalize an item. When you add this feature to your listings, buyers can add their personalized text on the View Item page in certain categories, which can then be sent to you using the “message to seller” option. Buyers can now also filter for personalized listings when they search for items.\nTo set up your personalized listings, you’ll need to take the following action:\nAdd the “Personalize” item specific to your relevant listings\nAdd the “Personalize” item specific to your relevant listings\nProvide personalization instructions for your customers\nProvide personalization instructions for your customers\nTurn on the “message to seller” option\nTurn on the “message to seller” option\nIf you’ve previously used the personalization item specific, make sure you complete step 2 and 3 above to add this experience to your listings.\nThis option is currently available in certain categories in the following areas:\nAntiques\nArt\nBaby\nBooks & Magazines\nBusiness & Industrial\nCameras & Photo\nCell Phones & Accessories\nClothing, Shoes & Accessories\nCoins & Paper Money\nCollectibles\nComputers/Tablets & Networking\nConsumer Electronics\nCrafts\nDolls & Bears\neBay Motors\nEntertainment Memorabilia\nEverything Else\nGift Cards & Coupons\nHealth & Beauty\nHome & Garden\nJewelry & Watches\nMovies & TV\nMusic\nMusical Instruments & Gear\nPet Supplies\nPottery & Glass\nSpecialty Services\nSporting Goods\nSports Mem, Cards & Fan Shop\nStamps\nTickets & Experiences\nToys & Hobbies\nTravel\nVideo Games & Consoles\neBay for business\nChoose to make your listings personalized.\n*Additional charges apply."

Fitment is a better way for sellers to list parts that fit a variety of vehicles. It’s also a great way for buyers to find parts that fit their vehicles. With new fitment listings, you can create one listing describing a single part and add a complete list of compatible vehicles. This eliminates the need to list one part multiple times to ensure all compatible vehicles are found in search.\nWhy should I use fitment listings?\nUsing fitment, you can include a detailed list of compatible vehicles for a single part right in one listing, reducing the number of listings you need to create. Compatibility information appears on the item page and is searchable. Your fitment listings get a boost in Best Match search, and you can use your 80-character title for popular search elements like brand or part number to better market your listing.\nWhy is eBay Motors making this change?\nWe developed the fitment feature to help you run your business more smoothly by simplifying listing creation and management and reducing repetitive listing. Buyers will be able to find parts faster and with more confidence that the part will fit, resulting in fewer returns and inquiries. Plus, fewer listings mean you pay less in fees.\nDo I have to use fitment in my listing?\nNo, using fitment will be optional at launch. However, listings that display compatible vehicle data created with the new feature will help get your relevant items in front of buyers via search and helps to avoid using multiple listings for the same item, a violation of eBay’s Duplicate Listing Policy.\nHow does the listing process work?\nThere are two ways to list with fitment:\n1. Search for your product in eBay's parts catalog while you are listing your item. A complete list of vehicles your part fits will appear in your listing. The eBay parts catalog is currently available in Car & Truck Parts & Accessories categories only.\n2. If you do not find a match for your product in our catalog, fill in the necessary compatibility information for tires and wheels by specification; for all other parts by vehicle details.\nWhy is the listing flow different for some subcategories?\nFor parts with clearly defined specifications like tires and wheels, you’ll be asked to provide details about the part itself. For example, specifications for tires include width, aspect ratio, rim diameter, load index and speed rating. For all other parts, you’ll be asked to provide details about the vehicle with which the part is compatible. These details include year, make, model, engine and trim.\nHow do I list using fitment?\nPlease view the “How to add fitment” section to select the right tool to list using fitment.\nWhat are vehicle details?\nVehicle details include year, make, model, trim, and engine. These are the details you can enter in the manual process.\nWhat if I don’t know, or want to provide, all the information about a compatible vehicle?\nEven if you do not enter all the details (e.g., you provide year, make, model but not trim or engine), the list of compatible vehicles will still include compatible vehicles with the details you provide. Example: A seller has a headlight that fits all 2002 Dodge Durango trucks. The seller chooses Year: 2002, Make: Dodge, and Model: Durango. The system recognizes that this 2002 Dodge Durango has multiple trims and engines. The system presents all compatible 2002 Dodge Durango trucks, with all trim and engine options, for inclusion in the vehicle compatibility list. Please note the system will return only information on vehicles using the details you provided (in this case 2002, Dodge, Durango).\nWhat if my part is not in the eBay catalog?\nIf your part is not in the eBay catalog (currently available in Car & Truck Parts & Accessories categories only), and you know which vehicles it is compatible with, you can add them to your listing by providing year, make and model of the compatible vehicles. It is optional to specify trim and engine information.\nWhat if I disagree or am not sure if the compatible vehicles for my part are correct?\nIf you are unsure that the information returned to you when you input your part type, manufacturer or number is accurate, use the manual process to input the vehicles you are sure fit the part you’re selling.\nShould I repeat the compatibility information in my title or description?\nThere is no need to repeat compatibility information in your listing title. Instead, use your title for popular search elements like brand, part type, MPN part number, equivalent OEM part number, part name, material, and any other part numbers (e.g., Platinum number). Some examples:\nOld title: Ford Ranger 88/07 Short Bed New Tonneau Bed Cover 6ft. New title: Freedom 9630 Black Tonneau Bed Cover 6 ft\nOld title: 19‍2-199‍4 19‍95 Honda Civic EG6 Headlights + Vision New title : JDM Blk Crystal Headlights w/Vision Amber Corner Lights\nYou can repeat compatibility information in your listing description, but this is not essential since this information will already be displayed on the compatibility tab and is used in search. Compatibility information in the description may not be surfaced in search.\nCan I transfer compatible vehicle info from an existing listing into a new one?\nYes, you can use information from your existing listing in a new listing with fitment by using the “sell similar” or “relist” options in the Sell Your Item form. Be sure to create a new title using popular search elements like brand and part number with your new fitment listing. Please be certain the information you transfer to your new listing is correct since you are responsible for presenting accurate information about compatible vehicles.\nCan I use the fitment feature with a third-party service?\nCheck with your third-party service provider to see if fitment is available.\nCan I use bulk relist features to modify large numbers of listings at a time?\nPlease use the Myfitment or Frooition tools for Bulk Update of Fitments.\nWhat are the item-specifics required to add fitment in tires (66471) and wheels (43953) categories?\nTires:\nSection Width\nAspect Ratio\nRim Diameter\nLoad Index\nSpeed Index"

        "content": "Product identifiers\nIncrease the chances of a buyer finding your item with product identifiers.\nWhat are product identifiers?\nWhen to use product identifiers\nBenefits of product identifiers\nIf you already have live listings without product identifiers\nWhat are product identifiers?\nProduct identifiers are unique codes created by the product manufacturer that can be used to identify a specific product. They work like barcodes and may include Universal Product Codes (UPCs), Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs), and Manufacturer Part Number (MPN). The type of product identifier you use can vary depending on the category you’re selling in.\nUsing a product identifier can save you time when creating listings. When you enter the product identifier, eBay will suggest a match if your product already exists in the eBay catalog. If there’s a match, many of the fields such as photo and title will be pre-populated.\nWhen to use product identifiers\nProduct identifiers are required when you’re listing in most categories on eBay. Only use product identifiers that exactly match the product you’re selling. If you select a product that’s slightly different, such as a model from a different year or with different specifications, you risk misleading buyers. When you use the correct catalogue entry, it could help reduce the number of return requests because people can be sure what they’re buying.\nIf there aren’t any matches in the catalog, you can select a category and create your listing manually.\nNot every product has a product identifier. If you are listing a product that has no identifier (such as antiques) or you aren’t sure what it is, then you can simply select “Does not apply”. Find the entire list of qualifying and required categories here .\nBenefits of product identifiers\nThe biggest benefit of adding product identifiers to your listings is that it increases the chances of a buyer finding your item. Product identifiers give buyers a way to easily find and compare what's available while knowing your product is exactly what they’re looking for.\nIf you already have live listings without product identifiers\nIf you selected “Does not apply” or didn’t have the product identifier handy when you created your listing, it’s well worth spending the time to go back and fill in any product identifiers.

Meet the minimum photo size\neBay requires a minimum of 500 pixels for an image’s longest side. Most cameras and camera phones will exceed this minimum, and bigger is better!\n3. Don’t use borders\nBorders aren’t allowed on any item photos, except if it’s a natural border created by photographing your square or rectangular item against a neutral backdrop.\n4. Don’t add text or artwork\nNo text or artwork, like “Free Shipping” or seller logos, may be added to photos. Use the title, subtitle, and description box to include details of your item.\n5. Use stock photos only for brand-new items\nStock photos cannot be used for pre-owned items. Catalog images are acceptable, but not as the primary photo for pre-owned items except those in the Books, Movies, Music, or Video Game categories.\n*Likelihood to sell based on an eBay study that reviewed 6.8 million listings that resulted in an increase in 4.5% more sales over this period; “better photo quality” defined as photos that measure 500 or greater pixels on the longest side, do not have added text or graphics, and are uploaded to eBay picture service. Individual results may vary and results assume that sellers do not increase the item price while making these changes."

The incentive will be paid for Qualifying Transactions that are attributed to you for any of your listings on eBay.com except for listings in the Vehicles and Real Estate categories. Please note that only your Qualifying Transactions associated with the eBay.com account used to register with the eBay Partner Network are eligible for the seller incentive.\nWhat if I already have an existing eBay Partner Network account?\nGreat news! If you already are signed up with the eBay Partner Network, the seller incentive credit benefit will automatically be applied to your existing account.\nWhat should I do if my eBay Partner Network application is still pending approval after 24 hours?\nIf you did not receive a notification about your application within 24 hours, please reach out to us here .\nCan I drive traffic to my eBay store and still earn the incentive credit?\nYes! As long as you create an affiliate link using one of our eBay Partner Network (EPN) tools and the traffic results in a Qualifying Transaction, you are eligible to earn commissions from promoting your eBay store or individual listings.\nNote: Stores using the ebaystores.com domain are not supported by EPN tools. If you have this type of store, we highly recommend updating to the new store experience here .\nCan I share eBay Partner Network links within my eBay listings or eBay Store?\nNo. eBay Partner Network links can only be posted outside of eBay, never on eBay property. This means that partners who are eBay sellers can’t include affiliate links within their eBay listings, eBay store or eBay Messages.\nLearn more about accepted promotional methods.\nOnce I’ve earned commissions, how and when will I be paid?\nThe eBay Partner Network pays out commissions once per month and are paid on the 10th of the month for the month before the previous month. For example, your May earnings will be paid on July 10. You can choose to get paid via Electronic Funds Transfer or PayPal.\nFor Qualifying Transactions on your inventory that are eligible for the 0% final value fee incentive credit, final value fees will still appear on your monthly selling invoice and must be paid as usual. These fees will be offset by two eBay Partner Network payouts to you—the commission earned and a seller incentive credit (see example above). The credit will appear as a “Bonus” type in your eBay Partner Network Invoice Line Items (or click through to “Other Earnings” and look for Description: “eBay US: Earnings Credit: US Seller Incentive”).\nLearn more about how commissions are paid.\nHow can I identify which of my transactions earned the 0% final value fee seller incentive credit?\nThe eBay Partner Network provides a “ Transaction Detail Report ” (TDR) that indicates on which transactions you earned commissions. This report includes an 'Own Inventory' field that allows you to determine qualifying transactions on items you sold from your own inventory. These items would be eligible for the seller incentive credit subject to the terms of the incentive.\nIf eBay manages my payments, Am I eligible to receive the 0% final value fee seller incentive credit?\nYes. Sellers receiving payments on eBay are also eligible to receive the final value fee credit.

From July 1, 2022, we are legally obliged to make sure that our sellers are complying with these regulations.\nThis law forms a part of sellers’ Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which is a series of measures aimed at protecting the environment by improving waste management, limiting the use of landfills, and stimulating innovation in recycling. The 2019 Packaging Act applies to all businesses selling goods in the German marketplace, both domestic and international. To be compliant, you’ll need to license and register your packaging when you sell products in or into Germany, including product packaging, shipping packaging, and any filler materials used.\nTo help make the adjustment as smooth as possible, we’ve partnered with Lizenzero, an experienced solutions provider. For full details of the process and a comprehensive range of support services, we recommend that you contact their team.\nWhat you need to do\nIn order to be compliant with these regulations, you’ll need to complete these steps before July 1:\nLicense your packaging .

All companies, including SMEs, are now legally required to license their packaging.\nWhy do I have to pay my dual system a licensing fee?\nYour licensing fee pays for the disposal and recycling of your packaging from the point of sale to the time it is disposed of as waste.\nWhat is the Central Agency Packaging Register?\nThe Central Agency Packaging Register (ZSVR) oversees compliance with the Packaging Act by maintaining the LUCID database. As LUCID is a public-access register, compliance can also be checked by third parties. Dual systems provide regular updates of customers’ licensed packaging quantities to the ZSVR. If irregularities or deviations should occur, the ZSVR can issue official warnings, impose fines, or ban sales.\nDo I need to include any licensing logos on my packaging?\nNo, this is no longer required."

Coded coupons help to encourage repeat purchases, control your budget, and protect your margins.\nExamples of coded coupons include:\nUse code “REPEAT5” for $5 of your next order\nUse code “REPEAT5” for $5 of your next order\nBuy 1, get 1 at 20% off coupon code\nBuy 1, get 1 at 20% off coupon code\neBay Store subscribers can find coded coupons on the Marketing tab within Seller Hub.\nPrint, share, and send your coupons\nPrint your coupons\nGo to your Seller Hub Orders page and send a printed coupon code with your order to encourage repeat purchases.\nShare your coupons\nSharing your coupons on social media provides the opportunity to further the reach of your items, sales, stores, and discounts, and begin long-term engagement with new customers.\nSend coupons as part of an offer to buyers\nWhen sending an offer to your buyers, you can select the option to send a coupon code to those buyers that might not benefit from the offer.\nSend coupons from Seller Hub Orders page\nWhen reviewing past orders in Seller Hub, you can directly send a coupon to each previous buyer by selecting “send coupons” in the action menu.\nSend coupons in bulk to buyer groups\nYou can also send coupons in larger volume to a group of buyers who have bought from you previously with the buyer groups page in the Seller Hub Marketing tab.\nHow to share coded coupons\nThere are two ways to share coupons: publicly on eBay or privately off eBay.\nPublicly on eBay\nWhen setting up a public coupon on eBay, the coupon code will be visible on the search results, listing, and checkout pages. One benefit of sharing coded coupons publicly on eBay is that your terms and conditions (maximum discount, minimum spend, expiry date, etc.) will automatically be displayed on your listings and the Seller Offer page.\nPrivately off eBay\nWhen setting up a private coupon, the coupon code will not be visible on eBay. You’ll be able to print, share, and send private coupons to buyers that have previously purchased from you. You can also share your coupon code on social media or send it directly to specific buyers or friends. If you share coded coupons off eBay, then you’ll need to make sure the terms and conditions are clearly visible and you provide a link to the Buyer Terms and Conditions .\nHow to create a coded coupon\nIf you are an eBay Store subscriber, you can set up a coded coupon by going to the Marketing tab on Seller Hub. Select “Discounts,” then choose “Coupon” from the drop-down menu.\nNext, you’ll need to generate your desired code. Set the type of discount and its max budget. Finally, you can pick the inventory you want to be eligible for the discount and then launch your coupon.\nDashboard and reporting\neBay’s Seller Hub Discounts dashboard helps you understand your overall discount performance. Here you can see your base sales (sales without a discount activated), discounted sales (sales with a discount activated), and sales lift (discounted sales divided by total sales).\nIf you have many discounts, you can filter by offer type and status or use the search box to quickly find offers and see the performance of each discount. You can even download reports from eBay’s Seller Hub Discounts dashboard to share with others.\nFAQs\nWhat exactly are coded coupons?\nCoded coupons enable you to offer your buyers a discount through a coupon code. You can share coded coupons publicly (on ebay.com) or privately through your own marketing channels.\nHow do I benefit from using coded coupons?\nCoupons are a great way to engage and incentivize new and returning customers. They make your products appear more attractive to buyers, and may increase the likelihood of a purchase. Engaging buyers with coded coupons could be an ideal choice to make them return to your listings and storefronts to encourage repeat purchases.\nWhat are some of the ways I can utilize a coded coupon?\nSince coded coupons offer you control over your budget and flexibility in how you run your campaigns, they could be the right choice if you want to:\nOffer a discount to customers instead of adjusting the price of your items.\nLimit the budget on your campaign. When the decided budget is reached, the discount will no longer be visible on eBay.\nSend a printed coupon code note in your orders to encourage repeat purchases from buyers.\nWhere can I use coded coupons on and off eBay?\nCoupons can be displayed publicly on eBay on the search results page, on your listing page, and at checkout.\nTo offer a coupon privately, you may choose to print the code to add into a package, or to send a code to one or several buyers to incentivize another purchase. Additionally, you can share the coupon code on your social media, and also opt to send it to specific buyer groups or friends.\nHow do I differentiate Public and Private coupons?\nPublic Coupons: Anyone can see or use a public coupon at a number of places on eBay. These are useful for attracting new customers and encouraging previous buyers to come back for more.\nPrivate Coupons: You can offer private coupons to first-time buyers or repeat buyers for special shopping opportunities through your marketing channels or through Seller Hub.\nDo I have the flexibility to set usage limits on the coupons and control my campaign’s budget and duration?\nYes, you can control your budget and get flexibility in how you run your campaigns. Coded coupons may be the right choice if you want to:\nOffer a discount to customers instead of adjusting the price of your items.\nLimit the budget on your campaign. When the decided budget is reached, the discount will no longer be visible on eBay.\nSend a printed coupon code note in your order to encourage repeat purchases from buyers.\nIt is important to note that the sellers can apply limitations to the coupon usage by designating a campaign budget, minimum spend, the maximum number of redemptions, maximum discounts, and expiration dates to limit their exposure.\nWho can create coded coupons?\nThe coded coupons feature is available to Store subscribers through Seller Hub Discounts. While coded coupons can be shared off eBay (email, your own marketing channels) buyers must return to eBay to avail themselves of the offered discounts.\nAre there any plans to update and add new features to the coded coupon tool?\nWe are committed to continually adding more tools and features to help you run and optimize your business smoothly on eBay. Therefore, the team plans to add several more enhancements to the coded coupons in the future.\nAre the coupons stackable with other discounts, most notably with other Seller Hub Discounts?\nCoded coupons are not stackable with other discounts such as Order Discount and Volume Pricing. If several promotions are running concurrently on an item, buyers get the best discount. However, coupons do stack with sales events. If an item has a Best Offer or Seller Initiated Offer , the offer takes priority, and the coupon cannot be applied.\nCan I control how many times a coupon can be used by a buyer? Is max redemptions on the coupon mentioned as a whole or by a unique buyer?\nThe maximum redemption mentioned is per buyer. Therefore, a single-use coupon means an individual buyer can use it only once. The total spend (across buyers) is controlled by the campaign budget.\nIf I create coupon codes now, will it be possible for me to activate and deactivate them, so I have them for future use?\nYou are allowed to create a campaign with a code and put it on hold (pause the campaign) temporarily. However, a coupon campaign cannot be put on hold for an indefinite period of time and the code will be recycled after a certain time (currently capped at 30 days).\nSellers are responsible for adhering to the end dates of their campaigns and ensuring that their coupons are available throughout the campaign period.\nAre there any targeting capabilities? How should I target buyers who have not bought from my store recently? How can I reach out to buyers who follow our store?\nWe hope to add these enhancements to coded coupons in the future.\nHow does the budget for a coupon work?\nWhen the coupon discount spend reaches 90% of the budget limit, the campaign is paused and is no longer shown on eBay. Sellers are responsible for deleting coupon discounts shared privately through off-eBay marketing channels when the budget limit is reached.\nHowever, you always have the flexibility to keep the budget open to ensure that buyers are able to take advantage of the offered discount until the end of the discount period.\nWhat happens when my coupon discount spend approaches the budget limit?\nWhen the coupon discount spend reaches 90% of the budget limit, the campaign is paused and is no longer shown on eBay.\nHowever, you always have the flexibility to keep the budget open to ensure that buyers are able to take advantage of the offered discount until the end of the discount period.\nWhat happens once a coupon is paused?\nWhen a coupon is paused, it stops appearing on eBay. You may choose to resume the discount by adding more funds to the coupon budget if the redemption period has not passed.\nAs a seller on eBay, how should I ensure to stay updated on Pricing Tools Terms regarding coded coupons?\nTo ensure adherence to our policies governing the use of coded coupons, we recommend reading the eBay Pricing and Promotions Terms and Conditions .\nHow do I ensure the best buyer experience while sharing the coupons privately with them?\nWhen you share your coupons on eBay, crucial details, such as the maximum discount the buyer can receive, the maximum number of redemptions, coupon validity date, and any item restrictions or exclusions, will be automatically displayed on your listings and your storefront. However, while sharing your coupons privately with buyers through your own marketing channels, make sure to state and clearly link to the Terms and Conditions applicable to the coupons.\nWhat edits can I make in the coupon details once the discount is active?\nOnce the discount is already active, you may increase the total budget amount and extend the end date before expiration only.\nHowever, you cannot make any changes in the template for discount type, redemption limit and usage, the start date of the discount, and coupon code."

Instead of reducing the listing price, before and now prices on your listings will display for a limited time, boosting your conversion rates.

Inventory in these events will automatically rotate as discounts end and new items are discounted.\nOffer meaningful discounts\nCarefully consider the discount you’d like to offer so that your buyers feel like they’re getting a good deal. This will create a positive seller experience that may produce return customers.\nTargeted campaigns\nAvoid running one discount for your entire store. Instead, try to run targeted campaigns for specific categories or brands. If discounts are used for an entire store, buyers are often shown unrelated items that they have no interest in.\nPercentage discounts\nUsing percentage discounts is a great way to sell items with a lower value amount as they give you more control over the level of discount.\nTime your sale\nConsider which times peak in which months and align your discounts with sport events, Christmas, Black Friday, etc.\nConsider your stock quantities and item costs\nMake sure you have enough stock before putting items on sale, and choose items where you can retain a useful profit margin.\nHow do your buyers know when there is a sale event discount?\nDiscounts are prominently displayed in a variety of places on eBay. After searching or browsing, your buyers will see available discounts appear in red font in the list view. This helps buyers scan for deals while swiping or scrolling. Discounts are also displayed on the View item page, shopping cart and checkout page, your store’s Discounts page, and your store’s All Offers page.\nDashboard and reporting\neBay’s Seller Hub Discounts dashboard helps you understand your overall discount performance. Here you can see your base sales (sales without a discount activated), discount sales (sales with a discount activated), and sales lift (discount sales divided by total sales).\nIf you have many discounts, you can filter by offer type and status or use the search box to quickly find offers and see the performance of each discount. You can even download reports from eBay’s Seller Hub Discounts dashboard to share with others.\nSeller spotlight\nWant to boost your sales on eBay? Andrew Wright, Director of TheWrightBuy, explains how he used eBay sale events to do just that.\nFAQs\nHow do I create a sale event?\nStart by navigating to the Seller Hub and selecting the Marketing tab . From there, click on the Create discount button and choose Sale event . You’ll then follow the prompts to set your discount type, duration, and the items you want to include. This streamlined interface ensures a smooth setup, making it easy to showcase your best offers.\nLearn more about creating a sale event\nHow many items can I offer in my sales event campaigns?\nYou can list up to 10,000 items in your sales event campaigns.\nIf I create a sale event with Seller Hub Discounts, when will my items be discounted?\nUnlike “order discounts,” where the discount isn't applied until checkout, sale events discounts revise the item to reduce the price. When you discount an item (e.g. 20%), the item’s price on eBay reflects the sale event, and the discount will be applied at checkout. When your sale ends, your items will go back up to their pre-discounted prices, which may take several hours.\nWhere can buyers see my discounted listings?\nBuyers will see a special Strike-Through Price treatment in the following places:\nItem page (plus free shipping, if offered)\nSearch results\nCheckout page\nIn all other areas, the sale price will be displayed as the Buy It Now price (including in the main eBay search results)\nWhen I select the % off in the sale event only section, does this filter items based on which items are discounted by that amount?\nNo. This selection does not affect the items included in the offer; it only determines how the offer is worded for the buyer. Items will be included in the sale event regardless of the size of the discount. The criteria for inclusion in a sale event are:\nItems must have Strike-Through Pricing (STP), or percentage or dollar discounts\nItems must meet the inclusion/exclusion rules selected or be included in the selected SKUs or Item IDs\nWhen I select a % off in the sale event only section, does this apply at an additional discount to the items I select for the event?\nNo. Sale events are merchandising opportunities for already discounted items. A sale event only created through Seller Hub Discounts does not apply an additional discount. If you want to apply a % discount to a set of items, use the discount + sale event section.\nIs there a way I can configure the event to surface inventory in the order I prefer?\nThere is currently no way to change the order. The order is determined based on sales over impressions, so the best performers get the prime placements.\nLarge inventory sets: If an offer is a storewide offer or maps to multiple categories, Seller Hub Discounts fetches the other items in the offer for the same category and then displays the item based on popularity (impressions / sales).\nSmall inventory sets: If the number of eligible items is less than 500, Seller Hub Discounts grabs all of the eligible items and displays based on popularity, e.g. (sales / impressions).\nWe recommend sellers separate offers into logical inventory groups that people would tend to shop as a whole. The discounts team is working on improving this functionality.\nWhat kind of listings would qualify to be part of an offer?\nThe minimum requirements for qualification in a special offer are:\nStrike-Through Pricing (STP) pricing treatment is required for sale events only.\nItems must have a Buy It Now option. No Auction types are supported. Best Offer type with a Buy It Now component is supported, but discounts will only be applied if a purchase is made through Buy It Now. Once the buyer has made a “best offer bid” and that bid is accepted, the item is no longer eligible for other discount offers.\nWhen entering or selecting SKUs for SKU-based offers, multi-variation (color, size, style, etc.) items/listings must include the parent SKU ID to be eligible for the offer. Child variation IDs do not need to be added and will automatically be fetched per the parent SKU ID. If only the child SKU ID is included in the offer, this item will be ignored.\nItems with a Minimum Advertised Price, or MAP, treatment (item price is not displayed because it is below the Minimum Advertised Price) are not supported.\nWhat are SKUs? Where do I set SKUs?\nSKU stands for Stock-Keeping Unit, which is a general term for a catalog number for a specific item. SKU is also called “Custom Label” in eBay’s selling tools, such as Selling Manager, Selling Manager Pro, the bulk edit and revise tool in My eBay, and API.\nA SKU number can refer to a number generated by the manufacturer, or it can be a number that a seller creates for each item to manage their inventory. The SKU number for an item is provided by the seller when an item is listed or after it has been listed. Using SKUs or custom labels make it easier for you to re-list products with the same SKUs or custom labels, without having to also configure cross-sales for them each time.\nYou can add or edit SKU numbers in the “Custom Label” field of your listings using Selling Manager, Selling Manager Pro, the bulk edit and revise tool in My eBay, and API. Learn more about these eBay selling tools.\nWill creating and managing discounts on eBay improve my position in Best Match on the search results page?\nThere’s no “silver bullet” for getting a good position in search. Creating and promoting discounts on eBay will not directly give you an advantage in your listings’ search results rank; however, sales of all items with a special offer will count as a sale for each item’s listing. As a result, the listing will automatically move up in rank in Best Match over time as sale is taken into account in the Best Match algorithm. More importantly, by creating offers you are funneling buyers from search to shop your items alone.\nCan I run more than one offer at a time?\nYes. Multiple offers may apply to a given item or sets of inventory, however, the buyer will only see one offer message displayed at a time. If the same item is in more than one discount please reference the discounts display logic to see which discount will be given the priority.\nIn what order will items for my offer be displayed on the item pages?\nIn order to enhance the relevance of cross-sold items that are displayed on the item page, the eBay discounts tool will use an algorithm based on item price, shipping price, and quantity sold to determine the order in which your configured items are displayed. If your items are new and do not have sales history on eBay, the discounts tool will use the order in which you provided the SKUs to determine the display position.\nCan I add a SKU to my offer that I have not yet listed on eBay?\nYou can add a SKU to your offer even if you have not yet listed any item on eBay with that particular SKU. However, this SKU will essentially be ignored until an item with this SKU can be found for display with the offer.\nWhat is the limit of SKUs that can be listed in an offer? Is this limit going to change?\nYou can list up to 500 SKUs with each Order Offer. The limitation is in scope for the future roadmap.\nI have more than 500 SKUs that I need to discount. How can this be done?\nIf you have more than 500 SKUs to discount, the best practice is to select items by store category. You can also create a second store category for items to be placed in a discount. If you cannot create new store categories, you will need to separate the items into different order size discounts.\nCan I offer a shipping discount and a sale event?\nShipping discount offers may be applied on top of all other discount offers. The shipping discount threshold is evaluated after all other discounts have been applied.\nWhen I select the % off from the drop-down, does this filter items based on which items are discounted by that amount?\nNo. This selection does not affect the items included in the offer; it only determines how the offer is worded for the buyer. Items will be included in the sale event regardless of the size of the discount. The criteria for inclusion in a sale event are:\nItems must have Strike-Through Pricing (STP) treatment\nItems must meet the inclusion/exclusion rules selected or be included in the selected SKUs or Item IDs\nWhen I select the % off from the drop-down, does this apply an additional discount to the items I select for the event?\nNo. Sale events are merchandising opportunities for already discounted items. A sale event created through Seller Hub Discounts does not apply an additional discount. If you want to apply a % discount to a set of items, you can create an order discount with a minimum quantity threshold of 1 item.\nHow long does it take for edits to my listings to be reflected on my live offers?\nMost edits to your listings will appear immediately on your live offers. In the case where you change a listing to offer free shipping in order to qualify for an Accessory Discount offer, it may take up to 4 hours before the listing will appear with your live offer.\nCan I change the items that qualify for an offer once it has been active?\nYou can edit inventory rules and the list of SKUs selected for your offer at any time. Remember, you must have at least one SKU listed within your offer for it to be active.\nCan I schedule my offer in advance?\nYes, Seller Hub Discounts allows you to set offers to activate at a future date/time and specify the date/time when the offer should automatically deactivate. Once an offer is live you can also edit it, put it on hold, or end it prior to the specified end date.\nCan I schedule when to place my offer on hold or when to reactivate my offer?\nThe eBay tool for creating and managing discounts does not currently support the ability to schedule offers to be held or reactivated at a specific time. When you choose to place an offer on hold or resume an offer, it will take effect within 15 minutes.\nHow do I exclude SKUs from a discount?\nYou can exclude up to 100 SKUs from a discount on an item-by-item basis or by exclusion rule using eBay or seller store category. This can be done as part of Step 2 of offer creation, “Choose qualifying items for your offer.” You would select “Create exclusion rule.”"

Instead of manually initiating offers to buyers, this feature lets you automate your offers based on criteria such as category, price range, and item condition.

If you’re accepting Best Offers on a listing, you can still send an offer to eligible buyers if they’re watching a listing.

What if someone else wants to buy?\nHaving an open offer does not prevent others from buying the item. In addition, any offers that haven’t been accepted will be canceled when the item is sold or multi-SKU items are sold out to another buyer.\nWhat is the offer discount minimum based on Buy It Now price ranges?\nThe minimum discount is 5% across all item prices.\nCan I make an offer on shipping only?\nNo, sending an offer applies only to the item price and does not include shipping.

Once the buyer has made a \"best offer bid\" and that bid is accepted, the item is no longer eligible for order discount offers.\nWhen entering or selecting SKUs for SKU based offers, multi-variation (color, size, style, etc.) items/listings must include the parent SKU ID to be eligible for the offer. Child variation IDs do not need to be added and will automatically be fetched per the parent SKU ID. If only the child SKU ID is included in the offer, this item will be ignored.\nItems with a Minimum Advertised Price, or MAP, treatment (item price is not displayed because it is below the Minimum Advertised Price) are not supported."

Make it even more special with secure, professional packaging. It can help boost your seller ratings and drive repeat sales by making your business appear extra polished.\nTips to package like a pro\nPrevent your items from getting damaged in transit. Be sure to carefully wrap your items, especially fragile ones, and securely seal every box or envelope.\nYour packaging is a reflection of your business. Only reuse boxes that are in excellent condition and make sure all previous markings and labels have been removed or covered. Any visible markings from a previous label may result in delivery delays or returns.\nUsing one carrier’s branded packaging when you’re shipping with another carrier could cause returned shipments. Use generic, eBay-branded, or packaging provided by the carrier you’re shipping with only.\nWe offer a range of competitively priced, high-quality shipping supplies. Shop eBay-branded boxes, envelopes, bubble mailers, tape, and more.\nExpert tips for packaging your item\nDiscover the impact of packaging with insights from experienced sellers.\nMeasurements you’ll need\nWhen estimating shipping costs, the size and shape of a package, or the dimensions, are just as important as weight. There are a few key package measurements you’ll need, then we’ll calculate shipping costs for you. Measuring these correctly will prevent additional charges and returned packages.\nSmart ship tip : No matter what you’re measuring, always round up to the nearest whole number.\nLength Length is the longest side of the package, rounded up to the nearest inch.\nWidth Width is the shortest side of the package, rounded up to the nearest inch.\nHeight Height is from the base to the top of package, rounded up to the nearest inch.\nWeight The package’s weight on a scale.\nOther measurements\nCurious what else is involved in calculating shipping costs? eBay also uses girth and DIM weight:\nGirth is the distance around or circumference of a package, rounded up to the nearest inch. Keep in mind that most carriers have maximum girth limits. Get details by visiting USPS ®, FedEx ® and UPS ®.\nGirth for rectangular packages = (2 x width) + (2 x height).\nGirth for cylindrical packages = circumference of the cylinder.\nDIM weight is your package’s height x length x width, divided by applicable carrier DIM divisor. It’s not the package’s weight on a scale.\nBillable shipping is based on whichever cost is greater — the dimensional calculation or the actual scale weight of the package.\nPreventing shipping label price adjustments\nA shipping label price adjustment happens when you purchase a shipping label and the carrier determines that you’ve provided inaccurate information that results in an incorrect shipping label price. The difference is typically charged or credited to the original payment method used to purchase the shipping label.\nHere’s how to avoid the most common ones we see:\nYou’ll be charged if a carrier audits your package, and the dimensions or weight are different from the inputs provided when the label was generated. Or when the weight or dimensions of the package exceed the carrier’s weight or size restrictions.\nSmart ship tip : Always round up when you’re doing your own calculations. You can double-check your numbers before generating your shipping label using our shipping calculator .\nThere are additional charges for shipping using non-standard packaging. This includes items that are not fully encased in a corrugated box or outer shipping container, and cylindrical-shaped items such as mailing tubes, buckets, or pails.\nSmart ship tip : Get familiar with your carrier’s fees for non-standard packaging by visiting USPS ®, FedEx ®, and UPS ®.\nYou could be charged for services added after calculating shipping like Saturday delivery, address correction (rerouting package), future day pick-up, or on-call pick-up (if the sender does not have an account with UPS or FedEx).\nSmart ship tip : Be aware of services that cost extra and double check address details.\nLooking for more answers?"

If the ZIP code on your shipping label doesn’t match the ZIP code you’re shipping from, USPS may charge your customers additional postage that’s due upon delivery.\nWhich postal codes are excluded from USPS discounted labels?\nThese zip codes are priced with USPS published commercial rates for packages up to 20 lbs. for Priority Mail, Priority Mail Flat Rate, and Ground Advantage, so the label cost is higher than for delivery to most zip codes.\nWhat are the requirements for USPS cubic pricing?\nPackages\nWeighing less than 20 pounds\nWith a cubic feet volume up to 0.5 (864 cubic inches) cubic foot for Priority Mail and up to 1.0 cubic foot (1,728 cubic inches) for Ground Advantage\nWith each side measuring 18 inches or less\nHow do I calculate cubic feet volume?\nMultiply the package Length x Width x Height and divide by 1,728. eBay will automatically offer cubic pricing based on the package weight and dimensions you input.\nHow can I receive USPS cubic rates for my eBay shipments?\nSimply enter accurate weight and dimensions for your package when printing your eBay shipping labels. eBay will automatically offer the best rate, and apply cubic pricing for Priority Mail and Ground Advantage if the cubic rate is better than non-cubic rates.\nIt’s important to input accurate weights and dimensions to ensure you receive the best possible and accurate price when purchasing your labels.\nHow will I know whether I was charged cubic pricing or non-cubic pricing for my shipping label?\nIf you were charged for cubic pricing, you will see the cubic price tier above the USPS zone indicated on the top section of the label—remember, you will be charged the lower of cubic or non-cubic pricing for packages that qualify for cubic pricing.\nCan I ship mailing tubes with USPS cubic pricing?\nNo. Items that are tubular can only be shipped using USPS cubic pricing if they are enclosed in a cardboard box.\nHow can I ensure my listings with calculated shipping qualify for USPS cubic pricing?\nUSPS cubic pricing is available when you offer eBay discounted rates.

If you’re selling oversized items, consider listing and shipping with freight carriers. It’s the most economical option for delivering large, heavy items like appliances, furniture, large car parts, or gym equipment.\nFlat-rate freight vs freight rate tables\nYou can offer freight shipping options in one of two ways: flat-rate freight or freight rate tables. Both give the buyers information up front that helps to minimize back-and-forth communication with buyers while also allowing them to check out immediately.\nFlat-rate freight\nFreight rate tables\nUsing flat-rate freight is a simple and efficient process. It lets you offer a single flat shipping cost or free freight to all U.S. buyers regardless of distance or location.\nIf your freight shipping costs vary by region, you can pass those costs along to your buyers using a freight rate table. This gives you complete control over what you’ll charge, based on up to 100 buyer regions within the U.S. After you build your table using our tools, you can apply it within your listing flow or business policy and save for future use.\nTrack freight with these carriers\nWe’ve expanded the list of freight carriers eBay can track to help buyers follow their purchase along its journey. When you upload tracking numbers, make sure to tag the correct freight carrier and then tracking will be available for buyers. This will reduce inquiries about the status of that purchase while also minimizing “Item Not Received” claims.\nLooking for more answers?"

We’ve got the answers you need.\nPreparing shipments and determining shipping costs\nWhen are eBay Labels fees charged to my payment method?\nLabels are charged at the time of label printing. Learn more about printing eBay labels.\nWhat payment methods can I use to pay for eBay shipping labels?\nYou can use your funds to purchase shipping labels for the items you sell. If your funds aren’t sufficient to cover the full cost of FedEx, UPS and USPS labels, eBay will charge the remaining balance to your on-file payment method, such as a credit card or linked bank account. If you’re purchasing a USPS shipping label, and your funds aren’t sufficient to cover the full cost of the label, you can also use PayPal to purchase the label instead.\nAre carrier surcharges included in the charge for eBay Labels fees?\nApplicable carrier surcharges based on seller input weights and dimensions are included in the charge for eBay Labels fees and are also reflected in the eBay Shipping Calculator .\nFor FedEx and UPS these charges include fuel surcharges, additional handling for dimensions, weight or packaging, residential delivery charges and delivery area surcharges.

How can I dispute the adjustment?\nUSPS disputes should be submitted to USPS by contacting USPS Customer Care at 1-844-819-5187 or verifypostagehelp@usps.gov . Make sure you provide both the tracking number and the USPS Revenue Assurance ID to USPS. USPS will respond to the dispute within 5-15 business days.\nFedEx and UPS disputes should be submitted to eBay Customer Service . We will work with the carrier on reviewing the disputed charges. If your dispute is approved, you’ll see a credit to your Payments account for the adjustment amount and you’ll also get an email from eBay letting you know that the dispute was approved.\nI printed a label but I’m not going to use it. Can I void the label and get a refund?\nYes. You have up to 28 days from the time you print a FedEx, UPS or USPS label to void it and get a refund.

Learn more about applying carrier specific discounts to your listings.\nFor combined shipping orders, does eBay Labels combine package dimensions for all items included in the order for an accurate shipping cost?\nNo. Our shipping logic does not account for combined package dimensions for multiple item orders. If you select a non-flat shipping service such as regular Priority Mail, the site will calculate a shipping rate based on the weight of all the items purchased together at one time.\nWhat are shipping zones and how do they affect my shipping costs?\nZones aren’t actual geographic zones, but rather, codes that convey the distance a package has to travel in miles from its origin point.\nTo estimate your shipping zones for USPS, UPS and FedEx, use the table below\nAdditional resources\nUSPS Domestic Zone Chart : Click the “Get Zone for ZIP Code Pair” tab. Then, enter the origin and destination zip code.\nUPS Zones and Rates for the 48 Contiguous States: Enter the origin zip code and download zone charts to Excel\nFedEx Zone Finder : Enter the origin and destination zip code to find the zone for your shipment\nThe shipping service you select along with the shipping zone will determine the price of postage.\nKeep your address up to date in your eBay account and be sure that your return address ZIP code matches the ZIP code you’re actually shipping from.\nFor instance, if your business has locations in multiple states or the package drop off location near your work has a different ZIP code than the one near your home, be sure to use the correct ZIP code on your return address when shipping. If the ZIP code on your shipping label doesn’t match the ZIP code you’re shipping from, the carrier may charge you additional postage.\nHow can I avoid postage adjustments or surcharges related to package weight and dimensions?\nEnsure that your declared package weight, length and dimensions are below the limits for the shipping service you are using. Learn more about carrier limits by visiting USPS , FedEx and UPS .\nShipping with eBay Labels\nCan I print labels in bulk on eBay?\nYes, you can print up to 100 labels at a time (all with free automatic tracking).

In the Actions column, click “Void label.”\n3. Follow the instructions on the “Void your shipping label” page.\nCan I print shipping labels for buyers outside the U.S.?\nYes, eBay allows you to ship globally with our eBay International Shipping program . You’re still only responsible for the domestic leg of the journey and can use eBay Labels to ship to the domestic hub. eBay takes your item international.\nWhat information do I need to ship my order with a QR code?\nWhen choosing the QR code option, you’ll still need to enter your package’s weight and dimensions—and select a carrier and delivery option—just like you would if you were printing a label yourself.\nHow do I find a shipping carrier that accepts QR code scans?\nWhen choosing the QR code option, you’ll still need to enter your package’s weight and dimensions—and select a carrier and delivery option—just like you would if you were printing a label yourself.\nDo I still need to print a label if I choose the QR code option?\nAll eBay carrier partners (USPS, FedEx and UPS) offer a QR code option. However, remember to check if the carrier drop-off location nearest you supports QR codes using the links below.\nFind supported locations for USPS QR codes .\nFind supported locations for FedEx QR codes .\nFind supported locations for UPS QR codes .\nDo I need to download the QR code?\nNo, the QR code will be automatically emailed to you. Simply open the email on your phone or device to access the QR code. However, if you prefer, you can also download the QR code directly from the eBay Labels confirmation page.\nShipping hazardous materials\nWhose responsibility is it to understand and prepare hazmat shipments?\nGovernmental agencies consider the seller/shipper of the product responsible in understanding if your products are hazmat, how to prepare, and ship them. One of the best ways to identify if a product is hazardous is to locate its Safety Data Sheet (SDS) or Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and check Section 14 (Transportation). A quick search online typically is able to find the relevant document.\nDo I need to follow Hazmat Policy if shipping internationally?\nYes, sellers still need to follow domestic and international rules and correctly label their packages so eBay can be made aware that the shipment contains hazardous materials.\nWhat items are classified as hazmat or dangerous goods?\nThere are 9 classes of hazardous materials which present different hazards in transport. Explosives, Gases, Flammable liquids, Flammable solids, Oxidizing substances, Toxic (poison), Radioactive, Corrosive, and Miscellaneous hazards. Some of these classes are broken down into divisions that define more specific attributes. Use this visual guide as an aid.\nWho sets the rules for hazmat shipping?\nIt depends on the mode of transport. Domestically, the 49 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) sets the rules for shipping hazmat by land, air, and inland waterways. Internationally, the IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods) creates laws for shipment by vessel. The ICAO (International Aviation Organization) & IATA (International Air Transport Association) set the regulations for air transport. Find more information at these links:\nhttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49\nhttps://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Pages/DangerousGoods-default.aspx\nhttps://www.iata.org/en/publications/dgr/\nIf I follow all the rules, can a courier service still choose to reject my parcel?\nYes, couriers set their own standards on top of the already strict regulations. Couriers want to protect their employees and physical assets from harm. They may decide to forbid certain types of goods from transport on their aircraft, vessels, or trucks. For example, a few companies will not accept loose lithium batteries for transport because of fire concerns.\nAre there penalties for shipping hazmat without following the regulations?\nYes, failing to comply with the relevant regulation may result in fine, penalty, or even jail time. That’s why it’s very important to follow the rules set by governmental agencies and couriers. See penalties in the 49 CFR § 107.329 Maximum penalties .\nWhat are the most common types of hazmat?\nAs stated earlier on the page, the most common types we see at eBay are: lithium batteries, perfumes, nail polish, hairspray, cleaning supplies, lighters, and auto parts. That’s not the entire list, you may have a different type of hazmat depending on what you sell. The U.S. DOT offers a “Check the Box” guide to other types of common hazardous materials.\nWhat labels are required for packages containing lithium batteries?\nPackage marking and label requirements vary depending on factors such as number of lithium cells or batteries and watt-hours. Refer to this guide from PHMSA to understand requirements for the item you are shipping.\nUSPS also requires additional markings for packages containing pre-owned, damaged or electronic devices with lithium batteries. These packages must be marked “Restricted Electronic Device” and “Surface Transportation Only.”\nHandling time\nHow do I edit handling time for multiple items?\nInstructions on how to edit handling time for bulk listings can be found on the eBay bulk listings tools page .\nWhat are the benefits to same-day or 1-day handling times?\nOffering and delivering same-day handling or 1-day handling along with at least a 30-day money-back return policy can help you qualify for a Top Rated Plus discount and seal.\nWhy do carrier acceptance scan times matter?\nYour seller performance rating includes a late shipment rate calculation, and the maximum late shipment rate to qualify for Top Rated status is 3%. Your transaction will be considered on time as long as you have an acceptance scan within your stated handling time. Learn more about seller levels and performance standards.\nHow are holidays factored into handling times?\nUSPS® holidays are not counted as shipping days. Handle by dates that would normally fall on USPS holidays will reflect the next business day following the holiday as the “Ship by” date.\nHow does the Time Away setting affect estimated delivery dates?\nEstimated delivery dates and handle by dates will be adjusted when Time Away is scheduled for active listings. This means your buyers will receive realistic estimated delivery dates automatically without you having to manually change the time yourself.\nMore on how to set up time away .\neBay standard envelope\nWhy can’t I track eBay standard envelope shipments on the USPS website?\neBay standard envelope is an eBay Delivery Service and is tracked by our customers through their eBay accounts. Sellers can find the tracking information in My eBay or Seller Hub. If your buyer is asking for tracking information, please direct them to their purchase transaction history.\nHow do I handle an “Item not received” claim from a buyer?\nFrom time to time, eBay standard envelope shipments unfortunately may not track all the way through delivery to your buyer.

When your buyer opens a return, we’ll first notify you through Messages and in My eBay. We then make it easy for you to provide a return label or offer an alternative resolution, such as a partial refund. Once you have received the item back, you’ll have plenty of time to inspect it and issue a refund, all of which can be done directly from your Return Details screen.\nHow returns work\nGet notified\nWe’ll let you know when a return is requested.\nTrack the return\nFollow its progress on My eBay or Seller Hub .\nComplete return\nIssue a refund, replacement, or exchange.\nLearn how to handle a return request with our step-by-step guide.\nSeller tools for managing returns\nUse these seller tools to manage your refunds and create a returns policy that attracts and retains buyers.\nYou can save time by allowing your buyers to obtain a return label directly from eBay. If an eBay label is made available, your buyer can print it off as soon as the return is opened and automatically or manually accepted. Once the label is used, the charge will either go to you or your buyer depending on your return policy and the reason for the return.\nAfter your item is returned, you can easily issue a refund directly from your Return Details screen. Because managing many returns can be time consuming, we’ve set it up so that you’ll automatically issue a refund after 2 business days from when return tracking shows the item has been delivered back to you.\nThis process shortens the turnaround time of returns, helps sellers manage returns more efficiently, and reduces the likelihood of defects should the buyer ask eBay to step in to help with a return.\nNote: There are certain situations where the automated process may be delayed or may not happen at all. We do this to make sure we don’t automate in a situation where you are expecting a different outcome. For example, we won’t provide your buyers with a return label if you don’t accept returns unless you ask us to. For more details on when we pause automation, see the FAQs below .\nAttract more customers with returns\nA good returns policy can attract customers and keep them coming back. Here are some tips and features you can use to your advantage.\nMeet buyers’ expectations\nMany buyers expect a good returns experience that is consistent and competitive with a modern marketplace.

Knowing that an item can be returned free of charge gives buyers the confidence they need to make a purchase.\nTools and resources\nChoose from the most trusted shipping carriers and get exclusive discounts.\nEstimating your shipping costs just got easier.\nChoose when to issue immediate refunds.\nReturns FAQs\nWhen do return requests qualify for automatic acceptance?\nTo qualify for automatic acceptance, return requests must meet all of these criteria:\nYou offer returns on the listing\nFor remorse requests, it’s opened within your listing returns policy\nThe return is domestic and will be shipped within the US\nThe item does not exceed the size or weight limits for USPS first class package or priority mail\nIf a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number is required per the settings in your Return Preferences , we will ask you to provide it before the buyer can send the item back to you.\nWhat if my listings don’t offer returns?\nWe will not automatically accept the return. However, please note that if your buyer claims the item they received arrived damaged, is faulty, or doesn’t match the listing, you will still need to resolve their issue. If you are unable to, the buyer can ask eBay to step in and we may provide the buyer with a return label and charge you for the cost of the label.\nAlso, we may automatically issue a refund if the return tracking confirms delivery and a refund has not been issued within 2 business days.\nWhat happens if a return shipping label is not available for the transaction?\nIf a return shipping label is not available, we will ask that you and your buyer make arrangements to obtain a return label off eBay.\nWho pays for the return shipping label?\nThe party responsible for the cost of the return shipping label depends on your returns policy and the buyer’s reason for returning the item. Sellers are required to pay for return shipping if the buyer claims the item they received arrived damaged, is faulty, or doesn’t match the listing. For all other return reasons, who pays for return shipping is determined by your return policy.\nWhen a return shipping label is provided to a buyer, what type of label is provided?\neBay provides either a 1st Class or Priority Mail USPS label.\nWhat if I want to use a label from a different carrier than USPS?\nIf you are using a different label, in your Return Preferences , you need to opt into “RMA Number” (Return Merchandise Authorization). Then you will be able to upload your own label when a buyer requests a return.\nWhen will eBay automatically issue a refund on my behalf?\nWe recommend that you refund the buyer as soon as you receive the return. However, if the item’s tracking information shows confirmed delivery, 2 business days have elapsed, and the refund has not yet been issued to the buyer, eBay may automatically issue a refund on your behalf. eBay will also consider buyer and seller risk and performance data in determining whether to automate a refund.\nHow can I make sure my buyer receives a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number before they send the item back to me?\nYou can decide to offer a RMA number by checking the appropriate box in your Return Preferences page. We will ask you to provide the RMA number before the buyer can send the item back to you.\nHow can I issue an immediate refund for a return request instead of having the item sent back to me?\nYou can set up automation rules in your Return Preferences to immediately refund your buyer and let them keep the item.\nHow can I make sure that an item is returned to the correct location?\nTo ensure your items are shipped back to the correct location, it’s important that you always keep your return address up to date. You can update this in the “addresses” section of your account settings.\nPlease note that your return address set at the time the return was opened will determine where the item is sent. Once the return is opened, you cannot update the address."

His Basic Store gets him 1,000 zero insertion fee listings each month, and it only costs him 25¢ per listing after that, or $25 a month at his current volume. If he upgraded to a Premium Store with 10,000 free listings per month, it would cost him $13 more. For Paolo, it made more sense to keep his Basic Store with the lower monthly fee.\nJewelry, Premium Store\nJasmine chose a Premium Store because she loves the freedom of having 10,000 free fixed-price listings per month, since she sells multiples of 100 different products.

It shows trends, buyer demand, and even sold listings from other sellers. This equips you with the insights you need to easily determine the popularity of your items, understand their market value, and decide how to price them.\nWith the new sell-through rate metric, you’ll be able to see the percentage of similar items sold during a specific period of time. This means you can estimate the speed at which these items are selling, allowing you to quickly price your own items and get them on the market.\nSome of the other data you can see in the tool includes:\nActual sold price (incl. the accepted price for Best Offer listings)\nAverage sold price\nSold price range\nPercentage sold with free shipping/average shipping and number of sellers who have sold the product\nA price trend graph\nThe tool also has tons of other features, like a time-saving “Sell one like this” option. It  does all of the hard work for you by creating a new listing and pre-populating it with information from a previously sold one. All you have to do is modify the listing to describe your own item. You can also use advanced filters to refine your search settings and view a custom number of days, so you only ever see what matters to you.\nProduct research is available to all sellers on desktop when opted in to Seller Hub . To be able to opt in, you’ll need to have made at least one sale, then just click “Start using Seller Hub.” You can also use the tool on mobile if you have one active listing or have previously listed and sold within the last 90 days.\nStart using Product research now to get the info you need to unlock your selling potential.\nWhat sellers are saying\nRead what sellers (across the US, UK, and Germany) think of the Product research tool:\n“This seems like a good service to check out before making a listing.”\n“Easy to use with fast results.”\n“It saves me time researching what products will sell and what amount they will sell for!”\n“Excellent way to research and price items fairly.”\n“Easy to use with quick results and lots of sorting options.

Once approved, you’ll gain access to your financing portal that can potentially hold $5,000 to $2 million in available capital. You can take out multiple advances up to the maximum available capital as often as you need, without new applications or approvals for each advance.\nThis isn’t a loan and there is no interest. You’ll be charged a fixed fee every time you take out an advance from your available capital. Also, unlike a term loan that has fixed monthly payments, Flexible Cash Advance is paid on a pre-agreed percentage of your gross sales on eBay.\nAs you sell, you’ll be able to access more funds up to your approved limit. This makes it easier to buy inventory, manage cash flow, and invest in advertising to grow your business.\nBenefits\nEasily access the funds you need with a click—available whenever you want\nNo need to re-apply every time you need more funding\nOnly pay for what you use\nNo interest, no impact on credit score, no stress\nHow to apply\nSome sellers might receive a pre-approved offer in advance; if you don’t receive one, you can always apply with our financing partner . After filling out the application, you could be approved within 24 hours and given access to your financing portal, where you’ll see your available capital. From there, you'll be able to access funds as needed, and you’ll only pay fees on the amount you use. Any unused funds can be accessed via your financing portal for future use. Any unused funds will remain in your financing portal at no extra cost for future use.\nFAQs\nIs eBay the provider of Flexible Cash Advance?\nNo, this financial product is offered by Liberis, an eBay Seller Capital partner.\nHow is Flexible Cash Advance different from a Business Cash Advance?\nBusiness Cash Advance is an advance on your sales which gives you access to a lump sum of capital upfront once approved. This is not a loan—the cost comes in the form of a fixed fee, not interest. Also, unlike a term loan that has fixed monthly payments, Business Cash Advance is paid on a pre-agreed percentage of your gross sales. You only pay for the advance when you sell and if you need more funds in the future, you’ll have to apply for a renewal.\nFlexible Cash Advance provides you with ongoing access to a pre-approved amount of available capital that you can access whenever you need through your financing portal. You can take out multiple advances up to the maximum available capital without new applications or approvals for each advance. This is not a loan—the cost comes in the form of a fixed fee, not interest. Also, like a Business Cash Advance, Flexible Cash Advance is paid on a pre-agreed percentage of your gross sales. You only pay for the advance when you sell.\nWhat is Liberis?\nIn general, you’re eligible for an Flexible Cash Advance if you have:\nBeen actively trading for at least 12 months, with an average transaction amount of at least $500 per month during that time\nProcessed an average of 8 sales transactions or more over the past 12 months, and made at least 1 transaction in the last 3 months\nCompleted at least one sales transaction in the last 3 months and have not been declined from any Liberis product during that time\nFlexible Cash Advance may not be available for reasons other than the above. In which case, please contact our financial partner, Liberis, directly at info-us@liberis.com or (470) 582-1130.\nWhat are the fees?\nFlexible Cash Advance is designed to be fair and simple. Signing up and gaining access to your financing portal is free, and there’s no commitment to use funding from it.\nYou’ll only pay a fee when you take funds from your financing portal. The fee is a set price and you do not accrue any interest. You only pay for what you use.\nHow are my payments calculated?\nFlexible Cash Advance is powered by 20% of your daily eBay gross sales. This means you only pay when your customers pay, and not if you don’t make any sales.\nWill this impact my credit score?\nNo. As part of its assessment of your application for funding, Liberis carries out a soft credit pull which will not impact your consumer credit score.\nWhen will I receive my financing?\nLiberis may provide decisions in under 24 hours. Depending on your bank, your deposit could be available as soon as the next business day after financing approval.\nBoost your sales in Canada with eBay International Shipping\nWhat you need to know\nIf you sell items in Canada through the eBay International Shipping program, we’ve got great news. The item value limit (excluding taxes, duties, and shipping fees) on transactions to Canada will soon increase from $2,500 to $11,400 . This is applicable to orders shipped individually or through combined shipping, so more of your eligible listings will soon be available to buyers in Canada.\nHow it works\nThe increased item value limit will automatically apply to your eligible listings, and there’s no action you need to take.

We’re happy to let you know that we’ve revised our policy, and we’ll now remove feedback that sellers may receive in situations that don’t follow these updated policy guidelines. For better clarity, we’ve also updated our Feedback Policy page to clearly list these instances.\nWhat’s changing\nWe’ll now remove negative or neutral feedback in the following cases:\nWhen a buyer asks to cancel an order after placing it and the seller denies their request. Per eBay policy, sellers have the discretion to accept or deny a cancellation request.\nFor example: A buyer purchases a set of golf balls but then requests to cancel their order because they found a cheaper set elsewhere. The seller declines the request and the buyer responds by posting negative feedback. Since the seller is not obliged to accept cancellation requests, the feedback is removable.\nWhen a buyer changes their mind about their purchase and references being charged for the cost of an eBay return label.\nFor example: A buyer purchases a bracelet and after receiving it, they decide it doesn't suit their style and want to return the bracelet. When they realize there will be a charge for the eBay return label, they leave negative feedback about it. Since there were no other issues with the transaction and the buyer's comment is only about having to pay for an eBay return shipping label, the feedback is removable.\nTo learn more about what’s changing along with a clear list of scenarios where we’ll remove feedback, check out our new Feedback Policy page . To submit a request to have feedback removed based on these guidelines, head to the Seller Help page.\nInsure items up to $5,000 with ShipCover\nWhat you need to know\nShipCover is a cost-effective shipping insurance option that’s fully integrated with eBay Labels.

The service prioritizes quick and smooth claim resolutions, so you can dedicate more time to growing your business and not have to worry about your shipments staying safe.\nIf you’d like to learn more about ShipCover insurance, please visit our FAQs page.\nFAQs\nHow much does it cost to use ShipCover insurance?\nShipCover insurance starts at $1.70 per $100 of coverage for domestic shipping, and $2.83 per $100 of coverage for international shipping.

Your buyer can verify your claim by either opening a case in the eBay Resolution Center or with PayPal Buyer Protection. If your buyer has not opened a case, ShipCover sends an email to the buyer with details on how to complete the verification process.\nAre any items excluded from ShipCover?\nShipCover covers more items than most carriers; however, there are some exceptions.

It introduces specific safety-related information that businesses must provide when selling to buyers in the European Union (EU) and Northern Ireland (NI). If you don’t sell in or ship to these regions, the GPSR isn’t applicable to you.\nWhile there’s no action you need to take at this time, we encourage you to learn more about this regulation by visiting our General Product Safety Regulation page .\nScope of the GPSR\nThe General Product Safety Regulation applies to new, second-hand, repaired, and reconditioned items sold on eBay and all other marketplaces. There are few products and categories that are excluded from the GPSR—you can view the entire list of excluded categories on our Seller Center page.\nComplying with the GPSR\nThe GPSR requires all business sellers to add the following information for eligible items available for sale in the EU and NI:\nThe product manufacturer's name and contact information\nIf the manufacturer isn’t located in the EU or NI, you’ll have to indicate an EU or NI-based Responsible Person or entity, along with their name and contact details\nAny relevant product information like model number, pictures, type, and CE marking\nProduct safety and compliance information like safety warnings, labels, and product manuals in the local language\nWe understand that collecting this information can be time consuming, but adding it to your listings will ensure you comply with the regulation and can continue selling to buyers in these regions. It’ll also help you gain your buyers' trust and create a loyal customer base in the EU and NI.\nNext steps\nWe’re working on a new feature that’s designed to simplify the process of adding the required information to one or multiple your listings. We’ll notify you in July when you can start updating this information to your listings. In the meantime, we recommend that you start collecting this information so you’ll be ready to comply with the regulation once it goes into effect.\nFAQs\nWhat type of product safety information do I need to include?\nYou’ll have to display any applicable instructions, warnings for safe use and disposal, and safety information for the product you’re selling. This information must be presented in the local language of the country where your item is being sold. You can include an image (a pictogram, a symbol, or a label), a statement (safety warnings or chemical hazard warnings), a product manual, or any other document that contains this information. The supported file formats are .pdf, .jpg, and .png.\nWhere can I find the above information?\nThis information can be found on the product, on its packaging, or in any accompanying documents. You can also reach out to the product manufacturer if you don’t have this information.\nWhat does the Responsible Person need to do?\nThe EU or NI-based Responsible Person is in charge of specific tasks related to compliance and product safety, including :\nChecking that the EU declaration of conformity, CE marking, and other technical documentations are in order, and providing them to the market surveillance authorities to demonstrate the conformity of the product\nInforming the market surveillance authorities about dangerous products and accidents through the EU Safety Business Gateway\nCooperating with the market surveillance authorities and ensuring the necessary actions are taken to rectify any non-compliance issues\nProviding documented evidence of the checks that were performed, if requested by the authorities\nWho can be the Responsible Person?\nThe Responsible Person can be one of the following and must be based in the EU or NI:\nThe manufacturer\nAn importer\nAn authorized representative of the manufacturer\nA fulfillment service provider if the manufacturer, importer, and authorized representative aren’t based in the EU or NI\nIf the manufacturer isn’t in the EU or NI, how can I identify the Responsible Person?\nIf you’re a seller, you can contact the manufacturer or your upstream supplier to obtain the name and contact details of the EU or NI-based Responsible Person.\nIf you’re a manufacturer or brand owner that’s based outside the EU or NI and have a subsidiary in the EU or NI, or already have an EU or NI importer, it may be possible to appoint them as the Responsible Person for your products. You can also check with the testing laboratory or the certification company that you use, as they may assist you with assigning a Responsible Person.\nCan eBay help me find a Responsible Person?\nWe’re engaging with external service providers to determine if they’d support you with appointing an EU or NI-based Responsible Person. We’ll update this page and share more information if and when it’s available.\nShipping internationally just got easier\nWhat you need to know\nKeeping track of restrictions and export regulations when selling internationally can be challenging, and as a result you may have manually excluded selling in some locations. In mid-April we introduced a toggle switch within your Shipping Preferences under Exclude shipping locations that, when enabled, will allow eBay International Shipping to seamlessly handle the paperwork and shipments to locations you've previously excluded. This new feature aims to help make your products effortlessly available to a broader audience, while we handle the complexities of global distribution.\nSell internationally with confidence\neBay International Shipping was created to streamline your global shipping experience, so that when you make an international sale, you’re only responsible for shipping the item safely to our domestic eBay International Shipping hub. From there, we take care of the logistics and paperwork, and handle returns and refunds at no cost or risk to you. Adding this feature that manages your country exclusions with one easy toggle is just one more way that we’re working to improve your experience and help your products find their way to more buyers around the globe.\nSet it up\nTo check the status of this toggle switch, go to your Exclude shipping locations page under Shipping Preferences . You can either choose to have it switched ON and let us handle your exclusions for you, or have it switched OFF and manage them yourself. Once the toggle is turned OFF , your exclusions will be restored to how you manually set them.\nNote: Your self-ship exclusions remain effective at all times, independent of the toggle being ON or OFF .\nFAQs\nWhat are country exclusions?\nSellers use country exclusions to prohibit their listings from displaying and selling to specific countries. Occasionally, a seller may need to set a country exclusion when they have a brand or licensing agreement that limits sales to a particular location.\nWhat are the benefits of eBay managing country exclusions for me?\nWhen eBay manages your country exclusions, your listings are only shown where permitted, increasing their visibility to a wider international audience. It simplifies your role as a seller—you just ship to a domestic hub while eBay handles the complexities of global distribution, saving you time and effort.\nWhat protections do I receive by allowing eBay to manage country exclusions for listings that are eligible for eBay International Shipping?\nShould any complications occur during the international shipping phase, you retain the sale without any negative consequences to your account, such as VeRO strikes. Additionally, eBay will remove any neutral or negative feedback related to international shipping issues, safeguarding your seller reputation. You’ll also not be required to manage any returns—eBay will take care of them at no additional cost to you.\nIf I receive a verified rights owner (VeRO) complaint, am I protected through eBay International Shipping?\nIf an item is displayed on eBay International Shipping and there is a VeRO complaint, eBay will modify or remove the listing from eBay International Shipping. Negative account consequences won't be applied to your account.\nIf you offer additional international shipping services, you'll need to go to the 'Exclusions' section of My eBay and manually remove the countries that can't import your items. This will help ensure you only ship to countries allowed and that you don't receive negative actions if you self-ship these products.\nLearn more about the VeRO program .\nWill my country exclusions still be applied to any orders I self-ship internationally?\nYes. eBay will only manage exclusions for eBay International Shipping orders.\nHow do I apply my country exclusions to eBay International Shipping?\nWhether you use the listing tool or business policies, our how-to guide walks you through the process step-by-step.\nWhen will eBay International Shipping offer service to some expanded domestic shipping locations?\nWe realize that shipping to some US locations can be as complex as shipping internationally. So, coming soon, eBay International Shipping will also be available for shipping to:\nNon-contiguous states: Alaska and Hawaii\nU.S. Territories: Puerto Rico\nWill eBay International Shipping work the same way for these domestic shipments as it does for international shipments?\nYes. As the seller, you simply ship to our domestic shipping hub. Once your package is accepted at the hub, eBay will manage the rest of the process, including returns, and you keep the sale.\nWhat if I have excluded selling to Alaska and Hawaii in my shipping settings?\nIf your account is in good standing and you are already enrolled in eBay International Shipping, we will automatically display your listings to the expanded locations beginning at the end of August.\nWe’re testing changes to auction sales that’ll help you easily go from sold to paid\nChanges are coming to auctions\nAs part of our continuing effort to ensure timely payments for our sellers, we'll be testing changes over the next few months that are designed to streamline your selling experience, ensure you get paid without delay, and minimize the hassle of re-listing.\nWhat you need to know\nBuyers on select auctions will be required to set up a preferred payment method and shipping address before they can place a bid. After winning an auction, we’ll let them know they have one hour to adjust their order or payment details as needed, otherwise we’ll automatically process their order using their preferred payment method. No action is required from the seller.\nThese changes aim to improve the auction process on eBay by providing buyers with the ability to decide how they want to pay, while also ensuring that sellers receive payment for their sales. The goal is to foster a more efficient and dependable experience for the entire eBay community.\nNext steps\nKeep an eye out for these improvements which we’ve already begun rolling out.\nFAQs\nWhat is an unpaid item?\nCompleting a transaction with the buyer is typically a straightforward process; however, there are instances where the buyer may fail to pay for the item they committed to buy—this is referred to as an unpaid item.\nAs a seller, what is changing with Auctions?\nNo changes are needed with how you set up your listings. You should expect to see fewer unpaid items on items sold through auctions as we test and launch changes.\nAs a seller, can I still offer combined shipping for multiple items purchased by the same buyer?\nYou can still combine multiple purchases from the same buyer in a single shipment, but please be aware that a buyer may be automatically charged for shipping costs for each individual item when payments are processed. In these situations, you can send buyers a refund for any excess shipping charges if you offer combined shipping discounts. In the meantime, we are actively working on solutions that reduce the likelihood of this occurring.\nAs a buyer, what is changing when I bid on Auctions?\nAs a buyer, you may be prompted to provide a payment method and select a shipping address prior to placing a bid on an auction. You'll have the ability to edit these details before the auction ends. If you win the auction, you'll be given an one hour period to make any changes. If no changes are made, we’ll automatically charge your default payment method.\nWhat other changes is eBay doing to reduce unpaid items?\nWe’re continuing to rollout solutions across buying formats and different geographies to address instances of unpaid items. Additionally, we are restricting buyers with excessive instances of unpaid items.\nSellers are talking about the 2024 Summer Seller Update in the eBay Community."

This will provide you with a secure login experience across multiple devices and accounts, and add an extra layer of protection to your eBay account.\nDelegate more tasks with MUAA\nBoost your productivity and run your business more efficiently by securely assigning a wider range of work, including:\nMessages: Authorize other users to manage your inbox and the messages you send to other members of the community on your behalf.\nAdvertising campaigns : Enable other users to create, modify, and manage advertising campaigns.\nPromotions : Give other users the permission to manage promotions for your listings and associated buyer groups.\neBay Vault: Grant authorized users the permission to access your eBay vault so they can add cards and create listings for the cards on your behalf.\nEnhanced security with 2-step verification\nWe’ve introduced 2-step verification with authenticator apps so you and other approved users on your account can enjoy a safe and seamless login process. An authenticator app helps us verify your identity with device-bound, time-based, one-time passcodes (OTP) that reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your eBay account. It’s also more secure than traditional methods such as SMS, voice, and email OTPs.\nGet started\nEnroll in multi-user account access and enable other users to set up their own login credentials. For more information on how to start using multi-user account access, visit our Help page .\nWe recommend enabling 2-step verification and selecting Authenticator app as your verification method for each user account. During this process, each user will need to provide their credentials. For detailed instructions on setting up 2-step verification, check out our step-by-step guide .\nFAQs\nWhat is MUAA?\nMulti-user account access (MUAA) is an eBay feature ​​that lets you grant permissions to other eBay users, without compromising the security of your account. eBay users who’ve been granted permissions through MUAA must have their own eBay accounts and passwords, which they can use to login, access specific workflows, and perform certain actions on your behalf. Only the account owner can manage invitations and permissions.\nMUAA is currently available to all sellers who’ve opted-in to Seller Hub. For information on MUAA and how to use it, visit the multi-user account access page .\nIf I grant a user the permission to create and manage advertising campaigns, what actions can they perform?\nAuthorized users who’ve been granted permission to create and manage advertising campaigns will have access to your Advertising dashboard on Seller Hub. This includes visibility into all Promoted Listings Advanced and Promoted Listings Standard campaigns. The authorized user can create campaigns, generate and download listing reports, and modify and update campaigns.\nWhat is an authenticator app?\nAn authenticator app is a free software tool that’s installed on your smartphone and helps securely implement 2-step verification. It works by generating time-based, one-time passcodes (OTP) that you use to log in to your account. The 6-digit passcode generated by the authenticator app is stored locally on your device and doesn't require an internet or mobile network service. It's based on a secret key that's shared between the authenticator app and the eBay app or website.\nWhich authenticator apps are approved for usage?\nYou can use any authenticator app, but we recommend using Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy.\nShould I add a backup method of verification prior to enrolling the authenticator app?\nWe recommend adding your email and phone number as a backup in case you need to verify your information. For example, if you buy a new phone or lose your current phone, you’ll be required to use a backup method (phone number or email on file) to authenticate prior to re-enrolling into the authenticator app on your new device."

        "content": "Running your business\nNew features and improvements make it easier to manage your business.\nWhat you need to know\nNew improvements to reduce unpaid items for Buy It Now and Best Offer listings\nA simple way to meet European regulatory requirements\nDSA FAQs\nWhat you need to know\nNew improvements to reduce unpaid items for Buy It Now and Best Offer listings\nA simple way to meet European regulatory requirements\nNew improvements to reduce unpaid items for Buy It Now and Best Offer listings\nWe know that unpaid items have been a longstanding challenge for many of our sellers, which is why we’ve made improvements to reduce unpaid item incidents for Buy It Now and Best Offer sales. Since the recent launch of these improvements, we’ve already seen significant increases in successful payments for Best Offer items. Here’s what we’ve done in the past few months to improve the experience:\nChanges to Buy It Now purchases\nWe’ve increased the price threshold for Buy It Now items that require immediate payment. This update allows you to sell higher-priced Buy It Now items, and ensures that buyers are required to provide a payment method during checkout to secure their item.\nBest Offer updates\nAll buyers are now required to add a payment method when making offers on Best Offer listings. After you accept the offer, we’ll automatically charge the buyer’s chosen payment method so they won’t have to return to eBay to complete their purchase.\nThese changes are automatically applied to buyer offers, so you don’t need to update or make changes to your Best Offer listings. We also plan to launch similar changes for Seller Initiated Offers, buyer counter offers, and auctions to even further improve the experience for sellers.\nWe’re also implementing stricter policies–including account suspension–for users who repeatedly win auctions or make a Best Offer on items but fail to complete the purchase.\nUnpaid Items FAQ\nWhat is an unpaid item?\nCompleting a transaction with the buyer is typically a straightforward process; however, there are instances where the buyer may fail to pay for the item they committed to buy–this is referred to as an unpaid item.\nDo these features mean I won’t have any more unpaid items?\nThis is the goal. You should expect fewer unpaid items from offers as we scale this program; however, they may continue to happen from time to time in some specific scenarios.\nWill these changes apply to auctions as well?\nWe're testing similar solutions in auctions that require buyers to provide payment information before they submit bids on your listings. We’ll attempt to charge the winning bidder's payment at the completion of the auction, and you can expect fewer unpaid items on items sold through auctions as we scale the program.\nDo I still need to cancel unpaid items if they happen?\nIf an item is unpaid, you should continue to cancel the order just as you do today.\nAs a friendly reminder, you can enable the setting in which orders not paid for 4 days in advance will be canceled automatically (learn more here ). If canceled, you will not be charged the $0.30 final value fee per order.\nCan I control if my buyers get asked for payment and shipping information?\nYes, you can opt out of this feature in Buyer Payment Requirements . If you opt out, eligible buyers won’t be asked for payment and shipping information upfront when they submit offers and/or bid on your listings. We encourage you to remain opted in so your items are paid for and orders get created quickly.\nCan I still offer combined shipping for multiple items purchased by the same buyer?\nYou can still combine multiple purchases from the same buyer in a single shipment, but please be aware that a buyer may be automatically charged for shipping costs for each individual item when payments are processed. We are actively working on solutions that make this process simpler for you and your buyers. In the meantime, you can send buyers a refund for any excess shipping charges if you offer combined shipping discounts.\nNote: if a buyer’s payment is completed after a winning bid or an offer is accepted, there’s no need to send an invoice to the buyer.\nA simple way to meet European regulatory requirements\nUpdate your business seller account to comply with the Digital Services Act\nThe Digital Services Act is a regulation established by the European Commission to promote consumer protection. European law requires business sellers using online marketplaces like eBay include their business contact details on listings offered to buyers in the European Union.\nStarting in early 2024 , if you’re a registered business seller who sells to buyers in the EU, you’ll need to show your business contact details on listings available for purchase in the EU. We know following new or updated regulations can be difficult to track and take time, so we’ve made it easy for you to provide your customized business contact information.\nHere’s what you need to do\nLog into your Account Settings on My eBay and navigate to a new page called Public business information .\nYour verified business phone number and email will be pre-populated based on what you included when you registered as a business seller. If needed, you can change your pre-populated phone number and email. We recommend you use your business customer service information, if applicable.\nIf you sell to EU buyers they will be able to find your business contact details on listings available to them.\nBy sharing your business details you’ll earn trust with your EU buyers, and stay on top of the EU regulation before this becomes a requirement in early 2024.\nLearn more about the Digital Services Act .\nDSA FAQs\nWhat is the Digital Services Act?\nThe European Commission adopted the Digital Services Act (DSA) to provide increased consumer protections and transparency for European consumers. The DSA is a comprehensive new law that applies to digital platforms including online marketplaces like eBay. More details can be found about the DSA on the EU Commission website .\nWhich sellers would be required to provide their business information to EU buyers?\nIf you’re registered as a business seller on eBay and have listings eligible for purchase by EU buyers, then you’ll have to provide your business information. Starting in early 2024, your business seller information will appear on listings available for purchases to EU buyers.\nWhat information is shown on my listings?\nYour business name, business address, verified email and phone number, and where relevant, business registration number will appear on your listings available for purchase to EU buyers. It’s recommended that you include your business's customer service contact information (e.g., phone number and email), if applicable.\nWhy do I need to provide my business information on my listings?\nThis is a required update based on the Digital Services Act. By displaying your information on your listings, you’ll comply with the objectives of the DSA to drive transparency and increase trust.\nTo help business sellers comply with the requirements of the Digital Services Act, eBay is making it easy for sellers to add their customer-facing information within their Account Settings on My eBay. Public facing seller information will appear on your listings available for purchase to EU buyers.\nCan I change my pre-populated information if needed?\nYes, you’ll be able to change your pre-populated email address and phone number.\nAre there any exceptions for providing my business information publicly to EU buyers?\nThere are no exceptions for registered business sellers. This is a regulation that online marketplaces like eBay must comply with in order to offer services to buyers in the EU.\nIf I work out of my home, do I still have to provide my business information?\nYes, you will need to provide your customer-facing information if you have registered as an eBay business seller. Public facing seller information will appear on your listings available for purchase to EU buyers. eBay will be required to include this information on listing available to EU buyers in early 2024, which means you’ll need to include these details.\nHow is the Digital Services Act (DSA) different from what I provide based on INFORM?\nBoth the DSA and US INFORM are consumer protection laws that are designed to create a safe and transparent online buying process. When you register as a business on eBay, you’re asked to comply with these regulations that we adhere to as a trusted marketplace. This will include providing your business details (e.g., business name and address, and verified phone number and email). We recommend you add your customer service phone number instead of your personal number.\nThe information you provide during the registration of a business account can be used or you can customize it in the public facing information section of Account settings that will be used to comply with both regulations. For more information on INFORM, visit our Seller Center page .\nIf I use eBay International Shipping do I still need to include this information?\nYes, you still need to include your business's contact information. This is a requirement based on the Digital Services Act. By displaying your information on your listings, you’ll comply with the objectives of the DSA to drive transparency and increase trust.\nSellers are talking about the 2023 Fall Seller Update in the eBay Community."

Now, the Social page is available to not only Store subscribers but all eBay sellers in Seller Hub.\nSave time by linking your Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest accounts and create custom posts that’ll delight your customers and drive traffic to your listings. You can also post to multiple platforms at once and get insights into the traffic you’re receiving to your Store, listings, and other eBay assets from social media.

This tab will feature all your coupon sales in one place, and make it easier for buyers to find your sale items. With this update, your coupon offers will automatically be front and center on your storefront—helping turn browsing visitors into happy buyers.\nMore details\nThe Sale tab will automatically appear for store subscribers who’ve created at least one promotional coupon offer.\nWe’re exploring ways to include other promotions, such as markdowns, under the Sale tab in the future.\nIf you want to create a coupon offer that’ll show up in a Sale tab on your storefront, visit the coded coupons page to get started.\nSend offers for multiple listings at once with the eBay app\nYou can now send offers for multiple listings at the same time on the eBay app. In the past, you could only send offers for your listings one by one. Now, you can save time on the go, target interested buyers, and boost your conversion rate by quickly sending offers for multiple listings.\nGet started\nTo send offers for multiple listings, just go to the Active page within the Selling tab in the eBay app. You can send offers when a listing has one or more interested buyers who satisfy a number of conditions . When you have more than one listing that's eligible for offers, you’ll see a quick filter called Send Offers-Eligible . Just apply that filter to see those listings and send your offers.\nFor more information on sending offers for multiple listings, check out our Sending offers in bulk help section.\nList faster and easier with new AI-powered features\nOverview\nWe’re rolling out new features to empower you to create eye-catching listings more efficiently than ever. These features are already live for some sellers, and will be gradually rolling out across eBay in the coming weeks and months:\nAI-generated item descriptions\nImproved background removal tool\nWhat you need to know\nOur goal is to build an intuitive, effortless listing experience that helps you get your items up and running as quickly as possible. With this in mind, we’re rolling out new AI-powered features to help you create high-quality listings that showcase your items, starting with item descriptions and photos.\nAI-generated item descriptions\nAI-powered item descriptions are now available to all US sellers listing in most categories in the eBay app. This new feature can save you time by suggesting an attention-grabbing item description at the touch of a button. You can use the suggested description as-is, or easily customize it to add more detail, adjust for accuracy, or fit your business’ unique voice. Try it out today to get your listings up and running faster than ever before. We’ll be expanding this feature to desktop in the coming months.\nImproved background removal tool\nWe’re upgrading our background removal tool, making it easier than ever to showcase your item on a white background and increase your listing’s chances of standing out.\nWith just one tap, our improved tool will seamlessly create a white background for your item image, without the need for any manual editing or touching up. The improved background removal tool is already available to all sellers in the eBay app and anywhere you use the advanced listing tool, and will be expanding to desktop in the coming weeks.\nNext steps\nTo access AI-generated descriptions or the improved background removal tool just look for both of these features when you list on the eBay app. You’ll see these features become available across the eBay experience in coming weeks and months.\nOur goal is to make it easier and faster to create stand-out listings, and we’re continuing to explore how AI-powered tools and features can help you work more efficiently. Keep an eye out for more time-saving features to come.\nAI-Enabled Listings FAQ\nAre AI-generated listing descriptions available in all categories?\nThis feature is available in most categories, and we’ll continue to roll out this capability across additional categories over the next several months.\nWhat if my listing is inaccurate because of the automatically-generated information?\nOur goal is to put industry-leading tools at your fingertips to streamline how you list. While these new features can assist in suggesting listing details, AI doesn’t always get it right. It's important to double-check and ensure all information is correct before your listing goes live. Remember, sellers are responsible for the accuracy of their listings.\nIs it possible that my AI-generated listing descriptions will be the same as someone else’s?\nThis feature creates a unique description each time it’s used, based on information in your listing. That means it’s extremely unlikely for it to generate multiple identical descriptions. However, as always, if you see an issue, please contact us to report it.\nAre these features only available in the eBay App?\nCurrently, AI-generated descriptions are only available in the eBay app. Improved background removal is available in the app and anywhere you use the new unified listing experience.  We’re working toward rolling these new features out across all platforms.\nCan I use these features to update an existing listing?\nYes. AI-powered descriptions and improved background removal can be used to update an existing listing through the eBay app. Improved background removal can also be used to update existing listings through the advanced listing tool. Just edit the listing as usual to access these features.\nWhat if I want to touch up or edit my photo after I use the improved background removal tool?\nOur new background-removal tool is designed to create images with no need for editing or touch-ups. You can reject the changes, but once you apply and save them, you won’t be able to revert to your original image. You’ll still be able to crop, rotate, and edit contrast after using background removal.\nWhat if I want to opt out of any of these features?\nAI-generated descriptions and the improved background removal tool are optional. You’ll still be able to enter your own listing description or edit the AI-generated description, as well as upload images without using the background removal tool.\nWe’re helping buyers find your items by making changes to our categories\nWe continue to make category changes to bring eBay into closer alignment with industry-standard classifications, enhance search engine optimization (SEO), and make it easier for domestic and international buyers to find your items.\nPreviously, we announced that the category changes listed below would be live by October 24. We’ve made the decision to move this to early 2024. There’s nothing you need to do— just enjoy a successful holiday selling season. We’ll be in touch before the category changes take effect.\nIn early 2024, listings in the selected categories outlined below will be automatically moved to the most relevant new category. This may result in a change in final value fees (either an increase or a decrease).\nDo I need to do anything?\nNo, the process is automatic, so no action is required. Following these changes, your listings will automatically be moved to the most relevant categories, and your buyers will be able to find them more easily.\nWhich categories are changing?\nParts and Accessories\nPerformance Parts . We’re moving the Performance Exhaust, Performance Driveline & Transmission, and Performance Chassis, Suspension, & Brakes categories into their corresponding categories under Car & Truck Parts. We’re also moving the Diagnostic Equipment & Tools category into its corresponding category under Automotive Tools & Supplies. This will reduce duplication and help your buyers find the products they’re looking for.\nAutomotive Tools & Supplies. We’re changing our Automotive Tools & Supplies category to more accurately categorize products and simplify the buying experience.\nFashion\nWe’ve added a replacement shoe-box category to let you list empty shoe boxes independently from regular sneakers.\nLifestyle\nWe’re creating a separate category for Firearm Magazine Extenders, which helps us comply with applicable laws and regulations for magazine capacity.\nPolicy\nWe’re retiring some categories that are no longer compliant with regional regulations or eBay policies. This keeps you in line with legal changes, and ensures that non-compliant items aren’t listed on the site. To find out more about policy changes in the US, take a look at our page on Seller Center .\nNew Promoted Listings Advanced features\nWe have two new features that you can expect to see soon when using Promoted Listings Advanced. These updates are designed to help you create and manage your campaigns more effectively, as well as save you time.\nComing soon: Dynamic bidding\nThere’s a new dynamic bidding strategy coming soon for Promoted Listings Advanced that automatically optimizes your bids, creating a more efficient way of helping you stay competitive. Your keyword bids will automatically be adjusted to match our daily suggestions, taking the guesswork out of having to decide on a bid and keeping your campaigns running efficiently.\nDon’t worry, you can always choose to leave dynamic bidding off and your keyword bids won’t change unless you go back to adjust them.\nNext steps\nSoon, you’ll see a new option when creating or editing an existing campaign under Set your keyword bids prompting you to enable Dynamic bidding .\nDynamic bidding strategy FAQ\nWhat are the benefits of a dynamic bidding strategy?\nKeeping your ad campaign competitive in an ever-changing marketplace can be time consuming. The dynamic bid strategy offers you an effortless way to secure priority access to placements by automatically adjusting your keyword bids to match eBay’s daily suggestions.\nSuggested bids are meant to help you find an optimal balance between cost and performance. They are calculated using factors that may include item attributes, seasonality, and past performance.\nWhich campaign bidding strategy is used with quick setup?\nYou have control over which bidding strategy works best for you. You can update your bid strategy at any time by editing your campaign. With quick setup, you’ll be able to choose whether or not you want to switch on dynamic bidding. If you use dynamic bidding and quick setup together, we’ll set initial competitive keyword bids and update them automatically to the daily suggested keyword bid.\nCan I set up a budget for my campaign?\nYes, you can set up your daily budget for the maximum amount that you’re willing to spend on a single campaign per day. Some days you may spend less than your daily budget, but you will never be charged more than the amount you choose. Once your campaign has reached its daily budget, your campaign will stop serving ads until the next day, when the daily budget resets. Any unused daily budget will not roll over to the next day.\nNew smart targeting\nWe’re introducing smart targeting for Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns , designed to save you time by simplifying the setup process and automatically updating and maintaining your ad campaign settings. With smart targeting, you can easily promote your chosen listings, while we take care of bidding and targeting for you.\nWhen creating a campaign, you’ll now be able to choose between two options: Smart for a fast campaign setup and automated management, or Manual for more control over setup and ongoing optimization.\nAdditionally, with smart targeting, you can discover new keyword strategies for your manual campaign using the search query report from the smart Advanced campaign, making it easier to reach your advertising goals.\nMore placements, more visibility with Promoted Listings Advanced\nWith this release, you’ll also get access to new ad placements, including relevant listings pages in addition to existing slots in search results. This’ll provide more ways for your listings to get discovered across eBay. Please note, these ad placements are currently only available for Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns that use smart targeting.\nNext steps\nTo use smart targeting and gain access to the additional placements, choose the Smart option during the campaign setup. Then select dates, the listings you’d like to promote, set your daily budget, and you’re ready to go.\nGet started\nSmart targeting FAQ\nWhat is Promoted Listings Advanced?\nPromoted Listings Advanced is a cost-per-click advertising solution, which gives you priority access to placements across eBay to get your listings in front of interested buyers and help drive sales. Find out more by visiting our Seller Center page .\nHow does eBay determine when my smart Promoted Listings Advanced campaign ads are shown to buyers?\nAds are shown to buyers based on a combination of bid amount and relevancy. The more competitive the bid, the more likely your ad will appear in an eligible ad slot. Relevancy is determined by a number of factors, including the search query, page content, past performance, and marketplace trends.\nOnce I’ve launched a campaign, can I change from a smart to a manual Promoted Listings Advanced campaign, and vice versa?\nYou won’t be able to switch your campaign from smart to manual, and vice versa, after your campaign has launched. If you do want to switch, the best option is to end the existing campaign and then create an entirely new campaign.\nWhich should I use: smart or manual Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns?\nSmart Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns are ideal for both new and experienced sellers who want an easy setup and automated campaigns. Manual Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns are ideal for sellers who prefer more control and customization over all aspects of campaign creation and optimization.\nWill my ads appear in different placements across eBay depending on whether I choose smart or manual Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns?\nYes. At this time, smart Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns will show your ads across both search results and listing pages. Manual Promoted Listings Advanced campaigns will show your ads across search results pages.\nSellers are talking about the Fall 2023 Seller Update in the eBay Community."

By offering this option, buyers’ shipping costs will be determined by the weight and size of their entire order, rather than separately for each individual item.\nWith this new feature, eBay International Shipping will:\nOffer lower shipping costs for buyers\nAllow buyers to more easily order multiple items from the same seller\nIncrease conversion for sellers\nEliminate significant seller pain points, including the need for sellers to opt out of eBay international shipping or create new ‘combined’ listings specifically for a buyer\nComing soon: The ability to offer different international shipping choices for buyers\nWe know that buyers value having the ability to choose—that’s why we plan on giving them the option to select their preferred shipping method at checkout when purchasing internationally.\nIn the past, sellers could only offer eBay international shipping or their own international shipping option on a listing. Now, sellers who opt in will be able to offer both eBay international shipping and another international shipping option on the same listing. This will also give buyers the option to pay applicable import charges at checkout or defer them until delivery.\nNext Steps\nSellers interested in offering buyers an alternative shipping option will be able to opt in. It’s important to note that, should you offer both eBay International Shipping and another international shipping option and a buyer selects the non-eBay International Shipping option, you’ll be charged the international selling fee and will be responsible if the item gets lost or damaged in transit, or your buyer requests a return. Visit the eBay International Shipping Program page for more information on updating your listings.\nFAQ\nCan I combine anything into one order?\nItems from certain categories, such as goods containing lithium-ion batteries, might be excluded from combined shipping due to dangerous goods regulations.\nHow will current price limits be applied?\nCurrently, items up to $2,500 are eligible for eBay International Shipping. This price limit will be applied to the whole order - total order value (including shipping costs) shouldn't exceed $2,500. If it does, the order will be split into multiple orders up to $2,500 each.\nHow will current weight thresholds be applied?\nCurrently, scale weight thresholds for the eBay International Shipping program are set up at max 44 lbs for non-Canada locations and max 66 lbs for Canada ship-to addresses. Additionally, the package can’t exceed 48 inches in length and 84 inches in length and girth ((height x 2) + (width x 2)). These thresholds will be applied to the whole order - total order scale weight shouldn't exceed the threshold. If it does, the order will be split into multiple orders up to the threshold each.\nWhat will be the default shipping option shown to buyers?\nDuring the initial launch, the default will be the option with the lowest shipping cost. In the coming months, we’ll evaluate buyer purchasing behavior and make adjustments to how the default option is selected in order to maximize buyer conversion.\nSellers are talking about the 2023 Fall Seller Update in the eBay Community."

To help sellers resolve these scenarios, we’ve improved the process of submitting information to challenge a payment dispute.\nBenefits to the improved experience\nAfter listening to sellers’ feedback, we’ve made the following improvements:\nSellers now have the ability to add details and explain their reason for challenging a payment dispute by providing text up to 1000 characters.\nSellers can now upload up to 5 separate files of information such as tracking details, shipping labels, messages, and photos. Previously only a single file could be uploaded, which required multiple files to be combined into one.\nWe’ll share the information you provide with the buyer’s payment institution to challenge the payment dispute. The information you submit may also improve your chances of qualifying for seller protections .\nPayment dispute FAQs\nHow much text can I enter when challenging a dispute?\nYou can add up to 1000 characters to help explain the reason you’re challenging a payment dispute.\nHow many files can I upload?\nYou can upload up to 5 separate files of supporting documentation such as proof of delivery/signature confirmation, shipping labels, messages, and photos. Because of file size limitations from payment institutions, the total size for all files must be 1.75 MB or less. We automatically compress your files to help you stay under the limit.\nWhat will eBay do with this information?\nWe’ll submit the material you provide along with any relevant information already available on eBay to the buyer’s payment institution to help defend the dispute. We may also use the information to determine whether the dispute is eligible for seller protections.\nWill this additional information help me win the dispute?\nProviding additional evidence may help demonstrate that the buyer isn’t entitled to reimbursement for the dispute. Learn more about handling payment disputes for information on what to include when you challenge a dispute.\nWill providing additional information help me qualify for eBay Seller Protections?\nYes. If you’re eligible for seller protections , we’ll consider the documentation you’ve uploaded during the payment dispute process.\nHow many days do I have to respond to a payment dispute?\nYou have 5 calendar days to respond to a payment dispute. You can view payment disputes in My eBay Sold or Requests and disputes in Seller Hub.\nWhat happens if I don’t respond and provide evidence?\nIn some cases, we may respond to a payment dispute on your behalf with the internal information we have related to the transaction.\nWhy is eBay requesting information that I’ve already provided?\nWe’d like to give you the opportunity to provide any additional relevant information that wasn’t previously shared. Additional supporting documentation or text may help the buyer’s payment institution make a decision on the payment dispute.\nReporting inappropriate messages\nTo keep eBay a safe marketplace, you can now report inappropriate messages and/or block members directly from conversations. Preventing abusive behavior is one of our priorities and these security measures empower you to act on and report any message or block a member who may be violating our policies. Your reports are extremely valuable and when submitted, we’ll review them and take action on any inappropriate messages.\nReport inappropriate messages and/or block members\nWe encourage you to report any inappropriate messages that may be violating our policies. You can also block a member from sending you messages. Here’s how:\nSelect Report message from your message menu and indicate the category the inappropriate message applies to—offensive, scam, threatening, unwanted, or other, and provide details. See the FAQs below for more details depending on the platform you’re on.\nYour report will be sent directly to us and we’ll review it and take action if the member has violated our policies. The actions we may take include sending warnings, blocking members from sending further messages, or suspending the member’s account.\nSelect Block this member directly from your message menu to easily block that member from your conversation. This will prevent them from sending you messages, bidding, or buying your items. Block this member doesn’t report the buyer to eBay.\nReporting inappropriate messages FAQs\nWhat should I do when I receive a physical threat?\nIf you receive a physical threat, contact your local law enforcement authority immediately. You should still take action to report this type of message to us and block the member from contacting you further.\nHow do I report an inappropriate or abusive message to eBay?\nYou can report a message directly from your conversation. Click the menu button in the top right corner (the 3 dots) in the conversation on iOS or Android, or through the Action button of your inbox on your desktop. Once you report the message, you’ll be asked to provide the reason for your report.\nWhat action does eBay take when a message is reported and what can happen to the member?\nWe take our members’ reports very seriously. Once your report is received, we’ll internally review the individual messages you’ve submitted and decide what action to take on any member who has sent a message that violates our policies, including sending warnings, blocking members from being able to send further messages, and suspending the members’ account.\nAny activity that doesn’t follow eBay policy could result in a range of actions including canceling listings, hiding or demoting all listings from search results, blocking some or all messages/communication with other members (including deleting, removing, or obfuscating all or part of any such communication), buying or selling restrictions, reporting to law enforcement, and account suspension. Learn more about our member-to-member contact policy . You don’t have to separately report this buyer to eBay.\nKeep your listings compliant with EU and UK regulations\nSelling into countries like France and Germany means you have to meet their local regulations, which may have an impact on your business. We’ve created simple ways to help you navigate how to get, and stay, compliant with international regulations.\nIf you sell to buyers in France or Germany this article will outline how to stay on top of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations. These regulations are part of a Europe-wide initiative that aims to protect the environment by improving waste management and stimulating innovation in recycling. We’ve created a new Help page that is your one-stop shop for all things regulatory.\nEPR in France\nIf you sell items in France, you’re now required to add certain information to your account and listings. In particular, you need to add your Unique Identification Number (UIN) to your account. You can do this on your Account Settings page, under Business Information.\nCheck your account and ensure your listings include the required information to stay visible on eBay.fr.\nLearn more about EPR in France, including how to find your UIN, eligible categories, and what you need to do to stay compliant on our Help page .\nEPR in Germany\nWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations are EPR laws that apply to electronics and electrical goods sold to customers in Germany. The German Electrical and Electronic Equipment Act (ElektroG) regulates the environmentally responsible disposal of electrical equipment. If you manufacture or import items into Germany that are subject to these regulations, you’ll need to add your WEEE number to your Account Settings under Business Information when you offer an item for sale to Germany.\nThe German Packaging Act (VerpackG) regulates packaging materials for items sold to customers in Germany.   If you’re selling items subject to these regulations, you’ll need to add your Lucid number to your Account Settings under Business Information when you offer an item for sale to Germany. If you’re shipping an item using eBay International Shipping, eBay will report and pay EPR packaging fees on your behalf so you’re not required to add a Lucid number.\nYou can find more information and examples of products that are affected on our Help page .\nItems containing hazardous materials\nIf you’re selling certain items that contain hazardous materials to buyers in the EU or UK, you’re legally required to include the hazardous characteristics as a part of that listing. You can find this information on the item’s label or accompanying documentation.\nYou’ll need to add this information when you create or revise a listing for any item containing hazardous materials. Learn more about which items are impacted .\nWe’ve developed a quick and easy way for you to add the required information to your listings.\nOur new item disclosure module will appear automatically when you’re listing in categories that are potentially impacted and will prompt you to add this information when creating your listing, if appropriate.\nIf you ship to the EU or UK via eBay International Shipping, eBay will determine whether your items are eligible based on the category you list in and won’t ship hazardous material through the program.\nRegulations FAQs\nDoes this apply to me if I’m using eBay International Shipping?\nIf you’re using eBay International Shipping to sell to Germany, eBay will manage the German EPR packaging obligations. If you want to sell electronics in Germany and/or to sell to France, you’ll still need to make your listings compliant with the country’s local regulations.\nWhat is EPR in France?\nUnder the EPR regulations, manufacturers, importers, and eBay business sellers are responsible for the entire lifecycle of the products they sell. Visit the Help page to find out if the new legislation affects your eBay business.\nWhat is EPR in Germany?\nThe German Packaging Act (VerpackG, German EPR Law) and the Electrical and Electronic Equipment Act (ElektroG, Elektrogesetz) affect business sellers whose items are offered to customers in Germany. Visit the Help page to find out if the new legislation affects your eBay business.\nWhat happens if I don’t provide this information?\nItems on ebay.fr and ebay.de that aren’t compliant could be blocked from listing or removed.\nWhen will I see the new item disclosure module?\nYou’ll be able to see it when you list an item that potentially falls under specific regulations in certain countries. You can already use the module on ebay.de, and you’ll be able to use it on other eBay sites starting from mid-July.\nSellers are talking about the 2023 Summer Seller Update in the eBay Community."

With this in mind, we’ve developed two new features for Promoted Listings Standard that will make managing and understanding your ad rates much simpler.\nDynamic ad rates. Now you can choose between a fixed or dynamic ad rate strategy where your ad rates will be automatically adjusted based on eBay’s daily suggestions.\nAd rate forecasting. Soon you’ll see a performance indicator when creating or editing a campaign that predicts how well it could do (your estimated impression share ) based on your current ad rate.\nStay competitive with dynamic ad rates\nYou now have the option to choose a dynamic ad rate strategy when setting up or editing an automated or simple Promoted Listings Standard campaign. Previously, only a fixed ad rate strategy was available for simple campaigns. Selecting the dynamic ad rate option means that your ad rates will be automatically adjusted to match our daily suggestions (up to a cap you set). This new feature helps save you time and makes it easy to stay competitive in the eBay marketplace.\nNext steps\nTo use this feature, simply select the dynamic ad rate option when creating or editing a simple or automated campaign. Once selected, your ad rate will be automatically aligned to the daily suggested ad rate.\nDynamic ad rate FAQ\nWhat is a dynamic ad rate strategy?\nThe dynamic ad rate strategy is one of the options sellers can select to determine how their ad rate is set. Rather than making manual updates, a dynamic ad rate strategy automatically aligns an item’s ad rate with eBay’s daily suggested ad rate, helping to keep your listings competitive in the marketplace. You still have the ability to set an ad rate cap to fit your advertising budget.\nWhy use a dynamic ad rate?\nKeeping your ad campaign competitive in an ever-changing marketplace can be time-consuming. The dynamic ad rate strategy offers you an effortless way to secure high-visibility placements by automatically adjusting your ad rates to match eBay’s daily suggestions.\nHow are the dynamic and fixed ad rate strategies different?\nThe dynamic ad rate strategy will automatically update each of your listings to align with the daily suggested ad rate to keep your campaign competitive. When using the fixed ad rate strategy, your ad rate won’t change once it’s been set. While you can edit a fixed ad rate, adjustments to dynamic ad rates are done automatically.\nHow does this impact the campaign setup process?\nThere is minimal change to the campaign setup process. The dynamic ad rate feature gives you the opportunity to automatically update your ad rate to match eBay’s daily suggestions. The dynamic ad rate will be available as a selection in the simple and automated campaign creation flows.\nCan I select dynamic ad rate when I edit my existing fixed ad rate campaigns?\nYes, you may select dynamic ad rate for your whole campaign when editing. Individual listings within a campaign can’t be switched to dynamic ad rate. To update an individual listing’s ad rate strategy to dynamic, please remove the listing from the existing campaign and add it to a campaign that uses a dynamic ad rate strategy.\nCan I change my ad rates when I’m using the dynamic ad rate strategy?\nWhen you select the dynamic ad rate strategy for a campaign, eBay automatically updates each of your listings to match the daily suggested ad rate. You may adjust the dynamic ad rate cap, which sets the maximum ad rate you’re willing to spend, but if you prefer to manually adjust your ad rates, select the fixed ad rate strategy instead.\nCan I update my existing fixed ad rate listings to match today’s suggested ad rate without switching my campaign to a dynamic ad rate strategy?\nYes. Go to the campaign dashboard and select the listings you’d like to update. Then select today’s suggested ad rate and your listings will adjust to match, but only for the day. You’ll have to make a manual adjustment the next day if you want your listings to match the daily suggested rate again.\nI’ve used the feature from Promoted Listing Standard’s automated campaigns that automatically updates my ad rate to match eBay's daily suggestion. Is the dynamic ad rate the same thing?\nYes. Automatically adjusting your ad rate to match eBay’s daily suggestion is now called the dynamic ad rate strategy and it’s available in simple and automated campaigns.\nGain valuable performance insights with ad rate forecasting\nYou’ll soon be able to see how your ad rate may impact your advertising performance and buyer reach before you launch a campaign. Our new ad rate forecasting feature will provide you with a real-time prediction of your estimated impression share during campaign setup and on your campaign details page. With this information, you’ll be able to extend your potential ad reach and budget your spending accordingly with the aim of boosting your campaign performance.\nNext steps\nOnce this feature becomes fully available this summer, it’ll appear on your campaign creation page, as well as your campaign details page. When adjusting your ad rate, you'll be able to see how increasing or decreasing your spending can impact the performance of your campaign.\nAd rate forecasting FAQ\nWhat is the ad rate forecasting feature?\neBay’s ad rate forecasting feature gives you a real-time understanding of how your selected campaign settings impact your advertising performance, so you can better predict your impact and optimize your advertising spend before launching a campaign.\nWhy use the ad rate forecasting feature?\nUnderstanding if your campaign’s ad rate is competitive and will reach the most potential buyers isn’t always easy. eBay’s at-a-glance ad rate forecasting feature gives you a real-time understanding of how competitive your ad rate is and offers actionable ways to make the most of your advertising spend before launching your campaign.\nHow does ad rate forecasting impact the campaign setup and editing process?\nThere is no change to the campaign setup or editing process. You’ll set up and edit your campaigns the same way you typically do, but you’ll have more information to help you make the most of your efforts. The ad rate forecasting metrics will automatically adjust based on the ad rate you set and the listings you choose. You may use this information to make selections that help you meet your advertising goals.\nWill the ad rate forecasting feature make my advertising campaigns more expensive?\nNo, the ad rate forecasting feature is meant to be used as a tool to predict your potential ad reach. You still have control over how much you’d like to spend on ad rates, but now you’ll be able to see in real-time how your rates may affect your performance.\nWhat does the “estimated impression share” mean, and what should I do with the information?\nThe estimated impression share metric balances your chosen ad rate with the maximum possible impressions your ad could receive. It helps to determine the impact your ad rate may have on your campaign’s overall success and performance.\nFor example, if your estimated impression share is 85%, it indicates that your choices such as ad rate, listings, and ad rate cap may result in you receiving 85% of the total predicted impressions for a campaign similar to yours. You can use this estimate to adjust your ad rate, remove or increase any ad rate caps, or select different listings to reach the desired impression share aligned with your advertising goals.\nSellers are talking about the Summer 2023 Seller Update in the eBay Community."

We’ve already taken steps to reduce unpaid items for Buy It Now sales, and we’re now working on extending these updates to Best Offer listings as well. In initial testing, we’ve already seen significant improvements in successful payments for Best Offer items and continue to track these trends as we roll out these features.\nChanges to Buy It Now purchases\nWhen purchasing a Buy It Now item, buyers will be taken directly to check out, where they’re required to provide a payment method in order to secure the item.\nBest Offer updates\nWe’re testing a new feature that requires buyers to add a payment method on file before making offers on Best Offer listings. After you accept the offer, eBay will collect payment from the buyer’s payment method automatically and buyers won’t have to return to eBay to complete the purchase.  We will continue to roll out this feature to most Best Offer listings over the coming weeks.\nOnce launched, these changes will apply to most buyer offers, so you won’t need to update or make changes to your Best Offer listings. We’re also working on adapting this feature for seller-initiated offers and counteroffers.\nFAQ\nWhat is an unpaid item?\nCompleting a transaction with the buyer is typically a straightforward process; however, there are instances where the buyer may fail to pay for the item they offered to buy–this is referred to as an unpaid item.\nDoes this program mean I won’t have any more unpaid items for offers?\nWe’re working to reduce unpaid items wherever possible and prevent the challenges they bring. You should expect fewer unpaid items from offers as we scale this program; however, they may continue to happen from time to time in some specific scenarios, such as offers with very high offer prices. Please note these changes don’t currently apply to auction listings.\nWhen can I expect these changes to go into place?\nThese changes are already live for Buy It Now listings. Our goal is to complete the changes for Best Offer Listings in the coming months.\nDo I still need to cancel unpaid items if they happen?\nIf an item is unpaid, you should continue to cancel the order and select the reason as an 'unpaid item'. You can also specify your preference on whether you want unpaid items to be canceled automatically after four days.\nCan I control if my buyers get asked for payment and shipping information for my Best Offer listings?\nYes. You can opt out of this feature in Buyer Requirements . If you opt out, eligible buyers won’t be asked for payment and shipping information upfront when they submit offers for your listings. We encourage you to remain opted in so your items are paid for and orders are created quickly.\nCan I still help my buyers who request combined shipping?\nWe know some of our buyers like to request combined shipping when they make offers on multiple items from the same seller. We are working on developing the right solution that addresses combined shipping without resulting in unpaid items.\nDo these changes apply to international sales?\nCurrently, these changes apply only to US buyers. We’re working on launching these changes globally in the coming months.\nSellers are talking about the 2023 Summer Seller Update in the eBay Community."

These measures make sellers responsible for the entire life cycle of their products.\nTo comply with French EPR laws, business sellers who sell in, or into, France, need to register with the relevant éco-organismes* covering the categories they are selling in, including packaging. A list of the categories that these laws apply to can be found here .\nWhat’s changing?\nSince July 1, 2022, all marketplaces, including eBay, have been legally required to make sure that sellers are complying with EPR regulations. By getting in line with these laws, you’ll be showing your customers that you’re supporting recycling initiatives in France and playing your part in contributing to a circular economy.\nMake sure that you add the information detailed below to your listings as soon as possible. From October 1, 2022 we will take action on listings that don’t comply with the regulations, including paying the ‘eco-participation fee’ on your behalf and invoicing it back to you, as mentioned in our User Agreement update in August.\nWhat do I have to do?\nFirst and foremost, if your listings fall under EPR law, you’ll need to get compliant as a matter of urgency. You can find a list of products and categories that these laws apply to here , under ‘Eligible categories’.\nIf you’re selling these items in, or into France, you’ll need to:\n1. Provide the Unique Producer Identification Numbers (UPINs) as item specifics in the ‘Regulatory compliance’ field of your listings\nTo obtain your UPINs, you’ll need to register with the relevant éco-organisme if you are the producer of the product in, or first importer into France. For a list of appropriate éco-organismes by category, see the ‘Eligible categories’ drop down on our help page . Otherwise, contact your suppliers.\n2. Provide the Eco Participation Fee as an item specific\nEnter the fee you are charged for each item in the ‘Furniture’ and ‘Electrical/ Electronic devices’ category into the separate field of the listing tool to display it on your listing.\n3. Display the Repair Score as an image in your picture gallery\nThis ranks the repairability of a product from 1-10 and needs to be displayed as an image in your picture gallery. Please note that this should not be the first picture.\nYour supplier should be able to provide your Repair Score . See the help page for more details.\n4. Arrange your Take-back procedure\nIf you sell in the Electrical / Electronic devices and Furniture categories, you’ll need to provide buyers with details about how you will collect their existing product at delivery, known as ‘one-for-one take-back’. Take-back policies can be found in the ‘custom policies’ section of My eBay .\nPlease contact your shipping carrier and/or your éco-organisme to arrange the take-back procedure.\nFor further information on EPR in France, please visit our dedicated help page , which offers comprehensive information and support to guide you through the process.\n*An Eco-organisme is a French company empowered by the French public authorities, within the legal framework of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), to manage the end-of-life of the equipment they put onto the market (collection, sorting, recycling, and recovery of waste).\nNew UK goods regulatory requirements\nFollowing the UK’s departure from the EU, the UK now has its own domestic regulations covering most goods previously subject to the EU’s CE marking. The CE marking shows that these products meet EU safety, health or environmental requirements. It’s important you prepare your business for these changes so you can continue to sell your items in the Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI) markets.\nWhat you need to know\nAs a result of the new regulations, there are two new types of marking to be compliant with for selling in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland:\nThe UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is the new product marking required to demonstrate that certain goods are compliant with the UK rules and can be placed on the market in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland). It covers all goods that previously required the CE marking.\nThe UKNI (United Kingdom Northern Ireland) marking is the new conformity marking for products placed on the market in Northern Ireland but only where a UK-based conformity assessment body has been used. It also covers goods that continue to require the CE marking.\nWhat action do you need to take?\nMake sure to review your listings and update the impacted items with the new markings by 1 January 2023. If you haven’t made the necessary updates by this date, any non-compliant listings may be removed.\nYou’ll find all the information you need to prepare your business for the new UK goods regulatory requirements in the four guides produced by the UK government below, including FAQs on how to attach the new markings to your goods.\nClick on the guide links below to find out more about the UKCA and UKNI product conformity markings:\nGuide to the UKCA Marking\nGuide to the UKNI Marking\nNew Product Marking and Conformity Assessment\nFAQ: New UK goods regulatory regime summary\nIf you place goods in the EU market, you still need to use the CE marking.\nClick on the links below to find out more about the CE product conformity:\nPlacing manufactured goods in the EU market\nCE marking\nRelated links\nUsing the UKCA marking (Gov.uk)\nUsing the UKNI marking (Gov.uk)\neBay Product Safety Policy\nSellers are talking about the Fall 2022 Seller Update in the eBay Community."

Finally, we will display a combined shipping cost (inclusion of domestic and international shipping cost) to the buyer.\nWhat’s the benefit to buyers?\nBuyers choose to pay duties and taxes either at checkout or upon delivery. eBay International Shipping also provides buyers with easy access to international return shipping labels and handles all of their returns details so you don ’ t need to worry about returns anymore.\nWill my buyer incur additional charges?\nWhen international buyers view your listings, they’ll see both shipping charges and estimated import charges.\nAt checkout, the buyer will see final charges based on the destination country, including the item price, shipping charges, and import charges (if applicable).

Later this year, buyers will also be able to request bundled offers on multiple items when they make a Best Offer.\nWe hope these changes will help you reduce operational costs and spend less time dealing with unpaid items, so that you have more time to focus on growing your business.\nWhat’s changing?\nLater this year, we’ll start asking buyers to pay when they accept a seller's Offer to Buyer or a counter offer.\nWe’ll also introduce a new feature that will let buyers request a bundled offer on multiple items. These multi-item offers can be completed in one transaction, saving you time and making it easier for buyers to purchase more of your items.\nNext steps\nYou don’t have to take any action. You’ll see more updates later this year as we roll out the bundled offer feature.\nListing page views overview\nWe’re updating to a more accurate way of counting listing page views\nHaving the right data at your fingertips is key to getting your listings to perform at their best. To give you clearer insight into your listings’ performance, we’re changing to a more accurate way of counting page views, and updating how we display traffic data on your listings.\nWe’re updating how we count listing page views to more accurately capture views by potential buyers.\nTo give you cleaner performance data, we’ll now show a 30-day rolling count of listing views instead of a lifetime count.\nYou’ll still be able to access data for the past 2 years in a new listing traffic history report.\nWe want you to have listing traffic data that shows as accurately as possible how many buyers have seen your listings. That’s why, in late April 2022, we’ll be updating how we count and report listing page views.\nThe current page view numbers on your listings count various types of traffic, including a significant amount of non-human traffic—one example is programs called “bots” that scan websites and now account for approximately 40% of internet traffic.* Learn more about non-human traffic and bots in the Listing Page Views FAQs tab.\nAlthough this non-human traffic is currently counted as a “page view,” it doesn’t represent real shoppers or lead to sales, and recent analysis has shown how much it inflates your page view numbers.\nAs part of eBay’s continual efforts to bring you better data to run your business, we’re updating to a new way of counting page views that will better filter out non-human traffic and more accurately show views by potential buyers.\nWhile the amount of non-human traffic on the internet is considerable, it also varies across categories and products. As a result, while most sellers will see a significant drop in page view numbers, the impact of filtering out more non-human traffic may vary. Importantly, the actual traffic from potential buyers to listings isn’t changing. We’re just updating what types of traffic we count as page views to more accurately show views by potential buyers.\nPage view counts based on this approach have been available in the Seller Hub Traffic Report and Promoted Listings reports for some time. The changes outlined above will increase the consistency of how page views are counted and displayed across eBay.\n*Statista, Global share of human and bot web traffic 2019-2020.\nYour listings currently display lifetime views, which leaves out important information about recent performance trends. Starting soon, we’ll be adjusting your page views to show a rolling 30-day count. We’re also adding a new listing traffic history report, where you can access page view data for the previous 2 years.\nThis updated 30-day view count makes it easier to see trends as they’re happening and adjust your listings to perform at their best.\n30-day rolling data makes it easier to spot trends and optimize listings. However, we know some sellers prefer to have data that spans a longer period, so a new listing traffic history report will show the past 2 years of view counts for each listing.\nThe new report will show a breakdown of views, including trends over time, for each individual listing. You’ll be able to filter for page views over various timeframes, from the past 24 hours up to the past 2 years. You can see an example of the new listing traffic history report in the screenshot below.\nStarting soon, you’ll be able to access this new report by clicking the page view numbers on your Active Listings page.\nYou don’t need to take any action. In late April, we’ll start rolling out the new way of counting page views. When your listings are ready to be updated to the new page view counts, you’ll see notifications on your Active and Unsold listings pages.\nListing page views FAQs\nWhy is eBay making this change?\nWe believe that this change will arm you with the best data possible to evaluate and optimize your listings’ performance. With more non-human traffic filtered out of your listing view counts, you’ll be left with a clearer picture of views from real people that have the potential to convert to sales.\nWhat is non-human traffic and bot traffic?\nNon-human traffic refers to any traffic that doesn’t come from real people viewing your listing pages, including traffic from “bots.”\nBot traffic exists across the internet, and occurs when a page is viewed by a machine instead of a real person. Because bot traffic doesn’t benefit sellers or lead to sales, we aim to filter out as much of it as possible from your listing page views.\nDid buyer traffic on eBay change?\nThere’s no change to the number of buyers on eBay, or the number of buyers visiting your listings. The change you’ll see in your page view numbers is a result of a new way of counting views that filters out more non-human traffic.\nDoes this mean I’ve been overcharged for Promoted Listings or selling fees?\nNo. Listings’ view counts are never used in the calculation of any fees, including Promoted Listings fees and ad rates.\nTry out the new eBay app messaging experience beta\nIn our Winter 2022 Seller Update, we announced the upcoming launch of a new messaging experience to make communication between sellers and buyers easier. The beta version is in the process of being made available for everyone to test on the eBay mobile app.\nTo try out the new messaging experience, first make sure the latest version of the eBay app is installed on your device. You’ll see “We’ve updated messaging. Try it now” at the top of your inbox. Tap on “Try it now.” If you don't see this message, don’t worry—we’re rolling out the beta test to more sellers over the coming weeks.\nDuring the testing phase, you’ll be able to switch between the classic view and the new beta version. Give it a try, and use the “Feedback” button in your app inbox to let us know what you think!\nSellers are talking about the Spring 2022 Seller Update in the eBay Community."

Because these new item specifics are crucial to giving your listings the best chance of being discovered, they’ll be required in mid-July 2022. You’ll be able to add them to listings starting May 17. These item specifics will be tagged as Required Soon, so it’s easy to see what you need to add.\nWe’re also working with industry experts to refresh how we structure some categories, and how we describe some item specifics within those categories, to reflect ecommerce trends. This means that when we roll out new item specifics, some category structures will also change, and we’ll update the names used to describe some existing item specifics. Learn more about category changes .\nThese changes are all key to helping listings be discovered by potential buyers on and off eBay, especially when buyers use search filters.\nTools to help you find and update missing item specifics\nWhether you have a lot of listings or just a few, we’ve got your back with time-saving tools and features to update item specifics :\nDownload/Upload file. Available in the Seller Hub Active Listings page, this tool identifies and updates missing item specifics in bulk.\nReminders in Seller Hub and My eBay.

These changes will be applied automatically for buyers, so you don't need to update or make changes to your listings.\nWe’re listening to our seller community, and we're on a journey to make things better for you. Managing payments for our users places eBay in a better position to collect payment for buyer commitments.\nUnpaid Items with Best Offer FAQs\nWhat is an unpaid item?\nAfter an offer is accepted, it’s usually a smooth process to complete the transaction with the buyer, but sometimes the buyer may not pay for the item they offered to buy. These are called unpaid items .\nDoes this program mean I won’t have any more unpaid items for offers?\nThis is the goal. We’re trying to tackle unpaid items wherever possible and prevent the challenges they bring. You may expect fewer unpaid items from offers as we scale this program; however, they may continue to happen from time to time in some specific scenarios, such as offers with very high offer price. Please note these changes do not apply to auction listings.\nDo I still need to cancel unpaid items if they happen?\nIf an item is unpaid, you should continue to cancel the order just as you do today. We recently streamlined our unpaid item process and moved it to the cancel flow, where you can specify your preference and whether you want unpaid items to be cancelled after four days.\nCan I control whether eligible buyers are asked for payment and shipping information for my Best Offer listings?\nYes. You can opt out of this feature in Buyer Payment Requirements . If you opt out, eligible buyers will not be asked for payment and shipping information upfront when they submit offers for your listings. We encourage you to remain opted in so your items are paid for and orders are created quickly.\nUpdates to how feedback is displayed and collected\nWe’re evolving how we encourage buyers to leave feedback, as well as how we display feedback and other information about your business, to help buyers get to know your brand and feel confident buying from you:\nWe’re launching an updated and simplified way to help you get ahead of negative feedback in the eBay app before you’ve had a chance to resolve the issue with the buyer.\nIt’s getting easier to collect and leave feedback, with automated reminders for buyers in some categories, and new ways to automate leaving feedback for your buyers.\nImportant information about your brand and business will now be more visible to buyers, no matter what platform they’re shopping on.\nYour Store will be getting a new Feedback tab to showcase customer feedback about your business.\nYou may see new information about your business displayed on your Store and View Item pages, as we continue to test and refine what’s most effective at driving sales for you.\nHelping you get ahead of negative feedback in the eBay app\nWith increased visibility on your feedback, it’s important that your buyers see an accurate picture of your business—not one that’s marred by an unfair negative review.\nThat’s why, starting in late spring, we’ll be rolling out a simplified way to help you avoid negative feedback. If a buyer starts to leave negative feedback on the eBay app before they’ve contacted you on the eBay platform, we’ll automatically encourage them to reach out to you and give you a chance to resolve the issue first.\nWe’re also making sure that buyers see a streamlined and friction-free way to contact you before they leave negative feedback on the eBay app, to make it easy for them to reach out to you first.\nAs we roll this out, it’s a great opportunity to win buyers over and turn a negative experience into a potentially positive review.\nMaking it easier to collect and leave feedback\nCollecting and leaving feedback not only helps build your brand reputation, it also inspires trust as you build relationships with your buyers. To help you do that, we’re launching in-line notifications for buyers on the eBay app to proactively remind them to leave feedback and help shine a light on great buying experiences.\nAfter an item’s estimated delivery, some buyers using the eBay app will start seeing a notification to leave feedback. This will be rolled out for refurbished inventory over the coming weeks and gradually expanded to more categories throughout the spring and early summer.\nWe’re also announcing in this Seller Update that all sellers will have access to previously subscription-only features free of charge. This includes a new way to quickly streamline and automate leaving positive feedback for your buyers to encourage them to keep coming back because of your great customer service.\nYour brand and feedback will be more visible across all platforms\nWe recently announced updates to the View Item experience on mobile web, with important information about your business getting a more prominent display. These updates have continued to show an overall positive impact on sales and conversion and will be expanding to the eBay app and desktop.\nYour seller name, logo, and feedback rating already appear directly under your listing’s title on mobile web and on desktop—now, you’ll start seeing the same experience on the eBay app. With more than 60% of eBay transactions having a mobile touchpoint,* and with the eBay app one of the most popular shopping apps in the US,** these updates will help give your brand and business as much visibility as possible.\nYour overall seller feedback and most recent feedback comments will also be displayed more prominently in the “About this seller” section across all platforms, not only on mobile web.\nBuyers will start seeing these updates on the eBay app over the next few weeks, and on desktop over the coming months.\n* eBay Fast Facts, February 2021 ** Leading shopping apps in the United States in 2021 (Statista)\nUpdates to Stores to help you grow your customer base\nAs Stores continue to evolve into a world-class tool to showcase your products, brand, and business, we’re making it easier for buyers to find your Store, and giving them an at-a-glance view of your feedback, to build confidence buying from you.\nIn 2021, we added a new way for buyers on mobile web to find your Store, with an easy-to-find link on your View Item page. This will be expanding to desktop and the eBay app—helping buyers on any platform quickly and easily navigate to your Store.\nOnce buyers are in your Store, they’ll start to see a more complete picture of your business with a new Feedback tab.\nThis new tab will showcase your customer service and the quality of your products by displaying your seller rating and your most recent feedback comments. From here, buyers will also be able to click into all of your feedback.\nThe new Feedback tab has already been rolled out for buyers on the eBay app, and will expand to all buyers across desktop and mobile web by early summer.\nMore ways to build trust with your buyers\nDisplaying the right information about your business in the right place can build trust and entice buyers to make a purchase—and drive sales.\nOur research shows that buyers want more information about your business to help them make purchasing decisions. As a result, over the coming months, we’ll test displaying new information such as sales history on Stores and View Item pages.\nThis research into what drives buyers’ decisions helps refine how we display feedback and other important information—and hone in on what helps you sell more.\nNext steps\nYou don’t need to take any action—just continue to provide great customer service and grow your brand across eBay, and we’ll continue to evolve new ways to help you see the benefits of your hard work.\nFee credit updates and Below Standard additional final value fee increases\nTo better support your business, we’re prorating final value fee credits for partial refunds that you provide to the buyer. In addition, when you approve a buyer’s cancellation request, the entire final value fee, including the $0.30 per-order fee, will be refunded to you. We’re also adjusting our additional final value fees for Below Standard sellers.\nProrated final value fee credits for partial refunds\nStarting May 2022, when you issue a partial refund to a buyer, we’ll automatically credit a prorated portion of your final value fee based on the adjusted total amount of the sale. Along with this, we'll automatically credit prorated portions of other applicable fees including Promoted Listings Standard and international fees. Fees such as the $0.30 per-order fee, Promoted Listings Express fee, and Promoted Listings Advanced fee will not be refunded. We want to support your efforts to make things right for your buyers and adjust your fees accordingly.\nPer-order fee credit for cancelled transactions\nCurrently, eBay keeps a $0.30 per-order fee when an order is cancelled due to a buyer request. This is in line with fees that other marketplaces and third-party payment processors apply in similar buyer cancellation cases. We're excited to announce that starting March 1, 2022, eBay will refund the entire final value fee, including the $0.30 per-order fee, when you approve a buyer’s cancellation request. We recognize that buyers may cancel transactions for various reasons at no fault of the seller and we want to support you by refunding 100% of the final value fee.\nBelow Standard additional final value fee increase\nIn our continuing effort to mitigate behavior that does not support good buyer experiences and negatively impacts sellers on our platform, we will increase additional final value fees for sellers who do not meet minimum seller performance standards for the US. Starting March 1, 2022, we will increase additional final value fees from 5% to 6% for Below Standard sellers . This fee does not apply to Above Standard and eBay Top Rated Sellers. You can check your current seller level on your Seller Dashboard .\nNew messaging experience in the eBay app\nWe’re in the process of rolling out a new, up-to-date messaging experience in the eBay mobile app that will better connect you to your buyers, improve the way you communicate with each other, and make it easier for you to manage your messages. If you’ve not received a notification in your mobile app yet, you will see it over the coming weeks. For now, the updated experience will only be accessible on your mobile app and the messaging experience on your desktop won’t change.\nYou’ll be able to opt in to the beta version of the new experience when you receive a prompt in your mobile app. This is not the full version of the new messaging experience, and you will see some additional features, such as the ability to create auto-responses and sending offers to buyers, when we launch the full version. You’ll receive an additional prompt in the app when it’s your turn to switch to the full version of the new messaging experience.\nWhile we are rolling out the beta version for your mobile, you’ll still be able to opt out and use the old messaging format. In late spring, once the full version of the new app messaging experience has been launched, we will start to move all sellers over to the new experience.\nThis new messaging experience means you’ll be able to keep a closer track of all your communications. Your inbox will also be easier to manage as all messages can be grouped together by buyer or by listing.\nMessages to and from your buyers will now be displayed in a more modern, user-friendly format. As with many other messaging platforms, all messages from the same person, for a specific item, will be grouped together in a threaded conversation. With threaded messaging, you’ll see both sides of a message conversation with a buyer in chronological order on one screen, giving you the full conversation history and context of each message.\nWhat’s changing?\nWe’ve refreshed the look and feel of how you and your buyers can view and send messages in your mobile app.\nThis new experience makes messaging much clearer and more straightforward to use, as individual conversations with buyers will be simpler to follow and keep track of.\nMessages in your inbox will be grouped by buyer and listing so it will be easier to stay on top of all your communications.\nThe full version coming later this spring will include features such as auto-responses and offers to buyers, and you’ll be able to flag and delete a message conversation.\nThe full version of the new messaging experience will be compatible with iOS, Android and later with desktop.\nWhat isn’t changing?\nFor now, the desktop messaging experience is not changing.\nWhile your messaging format and experience is changing on the eBay app, this does not mean we expect you to change the way you communicate with your buyers or to reply more quickly to your buyer messages.\nYou’ll still be able to contact your buyers whenever you need to—nothing is changing in that respect.\nYour old messages will still be available in the new format, as will any folders you’ve created. You won’t lose any of your messages. As with the old format, messages in the new experience will be kept for one year and then automatically deleted.\nNext steps\nLook out for a prompt in your message inbox in your mobile app to opt in to the new beta experience on your mobile. You can opt in to the new beta experience at any time, but starting in late spring we will begin to move all sellers over to the full version.\nBe one of the first sellers to try out the new messaging experience before it’s rolled out to all sellers over the next few months.\nLet us know what you think about it! You can find a button in your inbox to leave us your feedback.\nMessaging FAQs\nWhen is this change taking place?\nYou will shortly receive a prompt in your app to try the new messaging experience on mobile. You can opt in and opt out at any time in this beta version. This version will not contain all of the new features. Starting in late spring, we will begin to roll out the full mobile version of the new messaging experience to sellers.\nWill any formatting in the old messages break when they are imported?\nNo, formatting won’t break when importing messages to the new experience. However, HTML won’t be supported and messages will be shown as plain text.\nWill sellers and buyers see a different experience?\nNo, not if you use the eBay messaging system. All buyers will be able to use the beta version of the new experience until they are moved over to the full version. If you use a service provider, your experience isn’t expected to change, but the buyer will experience the new interface.\nWill I still be able to send buyers a private offer?\nYes.\nI reply to sellers using a service provider. What does this mean for me?\nYour experience will vary by platform, but messages will come to you in the standard format for your service provider.\nWhat happens to the desktop messaging experience?\nThe beta version and the full launch of the new experience refer only to the messaging in your eBay App. On desktop, you will still see the old experience for the time being. We are working on bringing the new, updated messaging experience to desktop and will notify you in your desktop inbox once it is ready for you.\nSellers are talking about the Winter 2022 Seller Update in the eBay Community."

This feature will be available soon to all sellers through your Selling preferences.\nIf you already had access to this feature through a Selling Manager Pro subscription, you’ll see an updated and simplified design. Your existing automated feedback preferences won’t change.\nAutomatically relist your auction items through Seller Hub\nTo help streamline how you list, you’ll be able to automatically relist your auction items through Seller Hub.\nYou can turn automatic relisting on or off at any time, on any eligible listing, through your Active Listings in Seller Hub. You can choose to:\nRelist continuously until the item sells\nRelist continuously whether the item sells or not\nIf you have automatic relisting set up through a Selling Manager Pro subscription, you’ll notice that we’re simplifying the available relisting options, and updating to a more user-friendly design.\nAccess more reporting features in the Seller Hub Performance tab\nWe’re bringing the most-requested features of Sales Report Plus and the Selling Manager Pro Sales Report into Seller Hub.\nYour Sales report under the Seller Hub Performance tab will have more detailed information and reporting, including:\nSales by eBay category and by format (fixed price or auction)\nSales by seller Store category\nYour number of overall buyers, and your number of repeat buyers\nSearch by listing title, item number\nWhat’s changing for sellers who have Selling Manager Pro?\nWe’re in the process of phasing out Selling Manager Pro, but are making most Selling Manager Pro features available in Seller Hub free of charge. Sellers who currently have access to Selling Manager Pro via a standalone subscription or through a Premium or higher Store subscription as of March 2022 will continue to have access to Selling Manager Pro inventory management features free of charge. After March 2022, new Store subscriptions will not include this functionality. Learn more about Store subscriptions .\nNext steps\nYou don’t have to take any action—you’ll automatically be able to access these features over the coming weeks. Visit your Selling preferences , your Seller Hub Listings tab and your Seller Hub Performance tab to try out these features.\nPromoted Listings updates and expansion\nOver the coming weeks, you’ll see additional features, entry points, management capabilities, and more for each version of Promoted Listings. These new elements will bring eBay closer to industry standards for paid advertising and are all aimed at boosting your success.\nFor Promoted Listings Standard , we’ve introduced a new Campaign Dashboard where you can use filters to see what’s working and what needs improvement in each campaign. You can now also make updates to your campaigns directly from the dashboard.\nPromoted Listings Express , the advertising tool for auction-style listings, has been expanded for use beyond the eBay app and onto your desktop. Additionally, a reporting feature has been added to the eBay app and is coming soon to desktop.\nFor Promoted Listings Advanced (BETA) , your listings will appear more frequently for relevant buyers when we introduce broad match keyword targeting. We’re also working on giving you more control over when your listings won’t appear by introducing negative phrase match keyword targeting.\nUpdates to Promoted Listings Standard\nPromoted Listings Standard now has a new Campaign Dashboard that allows you to edit your campaigns directly without having to go through the 3-step campaign flow. We’re also working on providing you with more insight capabilities that you can use to keep up with the competition.\nNote: Campaign Dashboard is currently not available for Automated Campaigns.\nPromoted Listings Express expansion\nWe’re expanding the availability of Promoted Listings Express . Promoted Listings Express is a campaign type where you pay a one-time fee to have your auction-style listings display as ads on similar listings’ pages.\nPreviously, this campaign-type could only be accessed via the eBay app, but this year we’ve added multiple desktop entry points:\nWhen creating a new auction listing on desktop (in the classic listing tool)\nFrom My eBay Active and Overview on desktop\nFrom the quick listing tool\nWhat’s more, reporting for Promoted Listings Express is now available on the eBay app and will be coming soon to desktop.\nNew keyword targeting capabilities for Promoted Listings Advanced (BETA)\nFor Promoted Listings Advanced (BETA) , we’re working on expanding our keyword match types to provide your listings with more opportunities to get seen by buyers. Match types are used to control how your listings appear and/or don’t appear in buyers’ search results based on specified keywords.\nCurrently, exact match and phrase match targeting is available, but there are plans to test broad match keyword targeting soon. Broad match can be used to help increase the visibility of your listings by allowing them to appear when your keyword is included as part of a search phrase, instead of exclusively as an exact match.\nFor example, if you bid on the keyword “red shoes”:\nExact match only allows your listing to appear for that exact keyword, so if the buyer’s exact search is “red shoes”\nPhrase match allows your listing to appear if the buyer’s searched phrase includes other words before and/or after your keyword, such as “size 6 red shoes”\nBroad match means your listing could appear if “red shoes” is anywhere in the search query, so if the buyer looks for “red running shoes”\nWhen adding keywords as part of your campaign set up, you’ll be able to decide how specific you’d like them to be by choosing whether to bid on each keyword as broad match, phrase match, or exact match.\nWe also have plans to add negative phrase match targeting, giving you even more control over how your listings will appear in buyers’ search results. While you are currently able to set “negative keywords\" that you don’t want your listings to show up for, this is only available with exact match targeting. For example, if you set “red sandals” as a negative exact match , then a buyer who searches exclusively for “red sandals” won’t see your listings in their results.\nWith negative phrase match , you can choose specific phrases that you don’t want your listings to appear for. This prevents a buyer from seeing your listing even if their search query includes additional words, as long as the negative phrase match keywords are in the same order. For example, if a buyer searches for “red sandals size 6,” your listing still won’t appear for them despite the addition of “size 6.”\nNext steps\nSome of these changes will be introduced over the coming months, but you can already begin to access Promoted Listings Express on desktop by creating a new auction listing (in the classic listing tool). You can also leverage the new Campaign Dashboard capabilities for Promoted Listings Standard. To access your Campaign Dashboard, go to your Advertising Dashboard and click on the campaign name from your campaign grid.\nSellers are talking about the Winter 2022 Seller Update in the eBay Community."

For example, sellers with a Basic and above eBay Store who sell in the Home & Garden category will see an increase from 11.7% to 12.0%, a difference of 0.3%. Final value fees for sellers without a Store will increase 0.35% in most categories. For example, sellers who sell in the eBay Motors Parts & Accessories category without a Store will see an increase from 12.55% to 12.9%, a difference of 0.35%.\nFees vary across categories as eBay always strives to achieve the lowest total fees across category competitors.

        "content": "General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR)\nOverview\nWhat you need to know\nFAQs\nOverview\nEffective from December 13, 2024, the General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR) aims to ensure the sale of safe products to buyers in the European Union (EU) and Northern Ireland (NI). This regulation applies to both new and second-hand products sold in these markets, and it introduces specific requirements for businesses regarding product safety information.\nWhat you need to know\nTo comply with the GPSR and related regulations, all business sellers listing items for sale in the EU and NI must include the following information:\nThe product manufacturer's name and contact information\nIf the manufacturer isn’t located in the EU or NI, you’ll have to indicate an EU-based Responsible Person or entity, along with their name and contact details\nAny relevant product information like model number, pictures, and type\nProduct safety and compliance information like warnings and safety information (which can be included in labels and product manuals) in the local language\nThe CE marking when required by the related regulations applicable to your product\nWe’ve introduced new functionality so it’s easy for you to add this information to your listings, and ensure compliance with the regulation when it takes effect later this year. To add manufacturer and EU Responsible Person details to your listings either individually or in bulk, follow the step-by-step instructions on our Regulatory contacts page. For instructions on how to upload product safety information and documents, check out our Help page .\nFAQs\nIf I’m a seller located in the US and selling domestically, does the GPSR apply to me?\nNo, the General Product Safety Regulation only applies to products sold in the European Union (EU) and Northern Ireland (NI).\nWhat type of product safety information do I need to include?\nYou’ll have to display any applicable instructions, warnings for safe use and disposal, and safety information for the product you’re selling. This information must be presented in the local language of the country where your item is being sold. You can include an image (a pictogram, a symbol, or a label), a statement (safety warnings or chemical hazard warnings), a product manual, or any other document that contains this information. The supported file formats are .pdf, .jpg, and .png.\nWhere can I find the above information?\nThis information can be found on the product, on its packaging, or in any accompanying documents. You can also reach out to the product manufacturer if you don’t have this information.\nWhat should I do if I don’t receive a response from the product manufacturer?\nYou can look up their contact information on the manufacturer's official website or a website authorized by the manufacturer. Alternatively, you can try reaching out to the product distributor.\nWhich categories are excluded from the GPSR?\nThe following products and categories are excluded from the General Product Safety Regulation:\nMedicinal products\nFood and feed products\nLiving animals and plants\nGenetically modified organisms and microorganisms\nAnimal by-products\nPlant protection products, also referred to as pesticides\nPlant and animal products related to their reproduction\nAntiques\nCertain types of aircraft\nTravel equipment operated by a service provider to transport consumers\nProducts that need to be repaired, reconditioned, or recycled prior to being used and are clearly marked as such\nTo view the entire list, download our Excluded Categories on eBay document . You can also learn more by checking Article 2 of the GPSR .\nDoes the GPSR apply to collectibles, including antiques and works of art?\nThe regulation excludes antiques, which, for purposes of this law, includes collectors’ items and works of art since they cannot meet the necessary safety requirements. Specifically, antiques are defined to include items of extraordinary age, works of art (created solely for artistic purposes), and collectors’ items (of sufficient rarity and historical or scientific interest justifying their collection and preservation). To determine if an item qualifies as an antique, please refer to Annex IX of the VAT Directive , which the GPSR specifically says can be taken into account.\nFor other categories, you can specify the Year of Manufacture or Year of Publication. Additionally, you can use model, product, serial, or batch numbers, as well as EAN or UPC codes to identify specific products or batches. Include these details, along with brand or manufacturer details in the item specifics area of your listing. You can also provide any additional information you have to help your buyers make an informed decision.\nWhat does the Responsible Person need to do?\nThe EU or NI-based Responsible Person is in charge of specific tasks related to compliance and product safety, including :\nChecking that the EU declaration of conformity, CE marking, and other technical documentations are in order, and providing them to the market surveillance authorities to demonstrate the conformity of the product\nInforming the market surveillance authorities about dangerous products and accidents through the EU Safety Business Gateway\nCooperating with the market surveillance authorities and ensuring the necessary actions are taken to rectify any non-compliance issues\nProviding documented evidence of the checks that were performed, if requested by the authorities\nWho can be the Responsible Person?\nThe Responsible Person can be one of the following and must be located in the EU or NI:\nThe manufacturer\nAn importer, if the manufacturer is not established in the EU or Northern Ireland\nAn authorized representative of the manufacturer\nA  fulfillment service provider if the manufacturer, importer, and authorized representative aren’t based in the EU or NI\nIf the manufacturer isn’t in the EU or Northern Ireland, how can I identify the Responsible Person?\nIf you’re a seller, you can contact the manufacturer or your upstream supplier to obtain the name and contact details of the EU or NI-based Responsible Person.\nIf you’re a manufacturer or a brand owner that’s based outside the EU or NI and have a subsidiary in the EU or NI, or already have an EU or NI importer, it may be possible to appoint them as the Responsible Person for your products. You can also check with the testing laboratory or the certification company that you use, as they may assist you with assigning a Responsible Person.\nCan eBay help me find a Responsible Person?\nWe’ve partnered with the following third-parties providers who offer GPSR compliance services for sellers, including the appointment of an EU-based Responsible Person:\nWebinterpret\nCert-Rep\nObelis\nEucerep at ebay_support@eucerep.com\nPlease note that this referral is intended to assist you in finding someone who may be able to help you comply with EU product safety laws. It’s important for you to confirm that these services are right for you. Additionally, eBay is independent from these providers and won’t be responsible for the quality of their work.\nWhat if the manufacturer of my product no longer exists or has gone out of business?\nThere’s no specific GPSR exemption for situations where the product’s manufacturer no longer exists. However, Article 51 of the GPSR states that EU nations shouldn't ‘impede’ the sale of any product that was first supplied for distribution, consumption, or use on the EU market before December 13, 2024, provided that product is covered by and complies with the General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EG). Like many new laws, the GPSR is subject to varying interpretations. To our understanding, Article 51 can mean that you don’t need to add the additional information required by the GPSR to listings for consumer products sold in the EU or Northern Ireland before December 13, 2024, and that are covered by and fully comply with the General Product Safety Directive.\nFor example, if you're selling an item that complies with the Directive and was placed on the EU or Northern Ireland market before December 13, 2024, and the manufacturer is out of business, you won’t need to provide GPSR-related information in the listing (for example, manufacturer information).\nIf you're unsure whether your products were placed on the EU or Northern Ireland market prior to this date, you could consider reviewing the Blue Guide on EU Product Rules . Maintaining clear and accurate records of when your products were first put on the EU / Northern Ireland market will help you determine which items are subject to the new requirements.\nEven if the GPSR doesn’t apply, you may still have informational obligations under other regulations. To be on the safe side, you can add GPSR-related information to any listing if you believe it’s necessary, including listings published before December 13, 2024.\nWhat if I sell second-hand items and don’t have information about the product manufacturer?\nIn general, used items are in scope of the GPSR. However, Article 51 of the GPSR states that EU nations shouldn’t ‘impede’ the sale of any product that was first supplied for distribution, consumption, or use on the EU market before December 13, 2024, provided that product is covered by and complies with the General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EG). As with many new laws, there are differing interpretations of the GPSR. To our understanding, Article 51 can mean that you don’t need, for example, to add the additional information required by the GPSR to listings for consumer products that were placed on the EU or Northern Ireland market before December 13, 2024, and that are covered by and fully comply with the General Product Safety Directive.\nFor example, if you’re selling a used item that complies with the directive and was placed on the EU or Northern Ireland market before December 13, 2024, you won’t need to provide GPSR-related information in the listing (for example, manufacturer information).\nIf you're unsure whether your products were placed on the EU or Northern Ireland market prior to this date, you could consider reviewing the Blue Guide on EU Product Rules . Maintaining clear and accurate records of when your products were first put on the EU or Northern Ireland market will help you determine which items are subject to the new requirements.\nEven if the GPSR doesn’t apply, you may still have informational obligations under other regulations. To be on the safe side, you can add GPSR-related information to any listing if you believe it’s necessary, including listings published before December 13, 2024.\nWhat if I don’t disable direct shipping to the EU and Northern Ireland, and don’t update my listings to comply with the GPSR?\nIf you don’t comply with the GPSR, your listings may not be visible to buyers in the EU and Northern Ireland.\nPlease note that eBay cannot provide legal advice, and these FAQs only constitute general information. For detailed advice on how the General Product Safety Regulation and other regulations apply to you and your specific products and listings, please reach out to your legal counsel."

It’s recommended that you include your business's customer service contact information (phone number and email), if applicable.\nWhy do I need to provide my business information on my listings?\nThis is a requirement based on the Digital Services Act (DSA).

Sellers can also use the transaction report in Seller Hub to reference the amount of tax withheld.\nWhy did I not receive all of my available balance after backup withholding?\neBay is required to apply federal, and if applicable state backup withholding until you provide us with your valid TIN (SSN, EIN, or ITIN).

Once the withholding is remitted to the IRS or the states, eBay cannot legally refund it, even if the order is returned.\nWhy did eBay backup withhold tax on my gross payout?\nTax law requires eBay to withhold on the gross amount of your payout. See Form 1099-K instructions (box 1a).\nWhere can I see the details of orders that were subject to backup withholding?\nIn the “All Transactions” page within Payments on my eBay and Seller Hub, you can see the transactions subject to backup withholding.

In those states where eBay is collecting tax, we will collect tax on shipping and handling where applicable.\nWhat states are sellers required to collect sales tax for?\nSellers are generally required to collect sales tax in any state where they have a physical presence, which has been the case even before the recent Supreme Court decision. As of October 1, 2019, 34 states will require the collection of sales tax. In addition, if a seller meets any of the new economic nexus standards in other states, they would need to collect and remit sales tax in those states as well. Sellers should consult with their tax advisor about tax obligations for each state as the rules may vary on a state-by-state basis. If you use platforms other than eBay for selling, you may need to aggregate all of your sales into a state to determine if you have crossed that state's threshold for economic nexus.\nWhere can I find more information about eBay collecting internet sales tax and which states eBay collects?\nPlease visit our Help page and look for updates on Seller News .\nIf a seller discounts the invoice, will the sales tax amount adjust as well?

Please visit our Form 1099-K FAQ page for more information.\nForm 1099-K FAQs\nWhat is a 1099-K?\nForm 1099-K is a document that taxpayers receive to report income from payment card and third party network transactions. It includes the gross amount of all payment transactions within a calendar year. This gross amount doesn’t include any adjustments for credits, discounts, fees, refunds or other amounts.\nLearn more about Form 1099-K\nWhy do I need a 1099-K?\nYour sales on online marketplaces like eBay are reportable once they exceed a certain amount. Because eBay processes payments for these sales, IRS regulations require us to issue a 1099-K for US sellers who cross the sales threshold for a given tax year.\nWill I have to pay taxes if I receive a 1099-K?\nNot necessarily. Just because you receive a 1099-K doesn’t automatically mean that you’ll owe taxes on the amount reported on your 1099-K. The 1099-K shows your gross receipts, but you are taxable on your net income.\nOnly goods that are sold for a profit are considered taxable, so you won’t owe any taxes on something you sell for less than what you paid for it. For example, if you bought a bike for $1,000 last year, and then sold it on eBay today for $700, that $700 you made would generally not be subject to income tax.\nPlease consult a tax professional if you have any questions about any tax filing or regulations.\nWhat happens if I have multiple accounts?\nIf you have multiple eBay accounts associated with the same SSN or ITIN, your thresholds are calculated by combining all payment transactions for the year. If your combined sales exceed the above thresholds, you’ll receive a 1099-K for each account, even if one or more of the individual accounts do not exceed the IRS reporting thresholds.\nWhere can I find more information about 1099-K?\nHere’s some general IRS FAQs on this topic.\nRefunds to a Buyer\nIf the buyer requires a refund—cancellation, full refund, less than full refund, or partial refund, eBay will refund the sales tax to the buyer in these cases since we collected the sales tax on the original transaction.\nThe best practice is to send refunds through the eBay platform. However, if the refund is carried out on the PayPal platform, the seller is responsible to refund the full amount paid by the buyer at checkout including any paid Internet Sales Tax.\nThe seller will have to review the original PayPal transaction for the total amount of tax due to the buyer and add this to the refund amount for a full refund or the proportional amount for a partial refund.\nWhen the seller refunds the buyer, eBay will credit them back any taxes refunded.\nHow can I check how much Internet Sales Tax was collected by eBay?\nOur Orders Report itemizes how much tax we collected and remitted for transactions in marketplace responsibility states . You can download your orders in a CSV (comma-separated) file from the “Manage all orders” page in Seller Hub.\nValue Added Tax in the EU\nIf you sell to buyers in the EU, you may be required to charge and remit Value Added Tax. Value Added Tax is similar to a sales tax. Generally speaking, it’s a tax on a business’s gross receipts from the sale of goods and services. For example, any eBay seller making sales to UK buyers and fulfilling those orders from UK-based inventory is likely obligated to register for, charge and remit Value Added Tax in the UK. Speak with a tax advisor to better understand how Value Added Tax applies to your eBay business in the EU and other countries outside the US.\nDo I need to register for Value Added Tax in the EU?\neBay wants sellers to be successful and legally protected, wherever you do business.\nRegistering for Value Added Tax in the EU may help you do both those things.\nWhether you need to register for Value Added Tax in an EU member state depends on the way you conduct your business.\nThe key factors that determine if you have an obligation to register for Value Added Tax are\nYour business’s country of establishment.\nThe location of your inventory.\nYour level of sales.\nIt’s each seller’s responsibility to ensure they are Value Added Tax-compliant.\nNext steps\nComplete the following steps to ensure you are Value Added Tax-compliant and to avoid potential selling restrictions\nRegister with the local tax authority in each country where you’ve determined you have a Value Added Tax obligation. For example in the UK, register with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) , the UK’s tax authority.\nProvide eBay with your Value Added Tax ID number , and we’ll automatically add it to all your eligible new listings.\nValue-Added Tax resources\nHMRC Value-Added Tax guidance for overseas, online retailers\nHMRC Value-Added Tax registration\nVAT FAQs\nI live in Europe, but I sell on ebay.com (USA) and most of my customers are out of the European Union. Must I pay VAT to ebay.com as an additional tax?\nSince you are doing business in Europe, you are required to comply with EU laws and regulations, as well as those in your own country. The eBay sites in Europe (such as ebay.sp, ebay.co.uk, ebay.de, etc.) are set up with the correct processes to help sellers meet these requirements. Learn more .\nDo I need to inform a buyer overseas about import charges?\nYes. Buyers are responsible for paying import fees, usually as part of clearing their parcel through customs or when they receive their item. If you offer international shipping, you can’t include these costs in the item’s purchase and shipping price. Make sure to let international buyers know this in your listings. If your item’s being sent using the Global Shipping Program , eBay will inform the buyer about import charges and these will be included in the order total at checkout.\n* Except in Vermont and Massachusetts where the threshold is lower irrespective of the number of transactions."
