Read our article on adding Best Offer to listings\nBest Offer is a great way to buy the item you’ve been looking for at a bargain price. As well as saving money, you won’t have to wait for the listing to end to buy your item, if the seller accepts your offer. In order to secure the item, however, you’ll need to be the first to complete payment for it.\nHow to make a Best Offer\nYou can make a Best Offer on listings that have a Make Offer button.\nOnce you’ve found an item you want to buy that accepts Best Offers, here’s how to make your offer:\nChoose Make Offer .\nEnter your offer. If you like, you can add a message to the seller.\nSelect Continue .\nOn the next page, you may be asked to confirm your payment and shipping information. Select Edit if you need to change anything.\nSelect Send .\nIf you’ve added the item to your Watchlist, you can also select Make Best Offer next to the item in your Watchlist.\nIf you’re making a Best Offer on an item that offers personalization, you can add your personalization comments in the Message field once you select Make Offer .\nTip Even if your offer or counteroffer is accepted, the item will remain available to other buyers. Selecting a payment method and enabling autopay when making your offer, will mean you pay for and secure the item as soon as the seller accepts.\nHow to find listings with Best Offer\nNot all listings have the option to make an offer, but you can filter your search results to find sellers who do accept offers.\nWhen you’re searching for the item you’d like to buy, you can select Accepts offers at the top of the search results to see listings with Best Offer.\nYou can also use Advanced search to find Best Offer listings:\nGo to Advanced search - opens in new window or tab .\nEnter your keywords.\nScroll down to Buying format and select Best offer .\nSelect Search .\nWhat happens after you make your offer\nThe seller has 24 hours to decide whether to accept or decline your offer. They can also suggest another price. If they don’t respond to you in that time, or if the listing ends before they respond, then your offer expires.\nIf the seller responds, they may:\nAccept your offer: Even after the seller accepts your offer, the item will still be available to other buyers until you complete payment for it. If you’ve enabled autopay, eBay will collect payment from you once the seller accepts your offer and the item will be secured instantly\nDecline your offer: You can still make another one (up to 3 on most items and 5 in most vehicles categories)\nCounter your offer: You can choose to decline, continue negotiating by making another offer to the seller, or accept by going to checkout and paying for the item\nTip Your offer only applies to the item price. Shipping costs and all the other terms specified in the seller’s listing remain the same.\nRetracting a Best Offer\nIf you've made a mistake when making an offer or a counteroffer, you can retract or cancel it in certain circumstances.\nYou can retract an offer if:\nThere are 12 hours or more left before the listing ends\nYou placed your most recent offer less than an hour ago\nYou won’t be able to retract your offer if:\nThe listing ends in less than 12 hours and it's been more than an hour since you placed your most recent offer\nThe seller has already accepted or declined your offer, or sent you a counteroffer\nYou’ve already made 5 offers in a specific category\nIf you’re using the eBay desktop site, here’s how to retract a Best Offer or a counteroffer if it meets the requirements above:\nGo to Bids/Offers in My eBay - opens in new window or tab .\nFind the offer you’d like to retract.\nSelect Review offer , then select Retract offer .\nYou can also retract your offer on the item page by selecting Review offer and then Retract offer . If you’re using a mobile browser or the eBay app, go to the Best Offer cancellation form - opens in new window or tab to retract your offer.\nTips for making offers\nWhen you’ve got your eye on something and have a certain price in mind, you can increase your chances of the seller accepting your offer by having a Best Offer strategy. Here are some tips for making offers:\nBe reasonable: Sellers who accept offers are flexible on price and generally take fair offers seriously\nAdd a message for the seller: A friendly, personal message could help you get the item at the price you want. Look for the Add message to seller option when you’re entering your offer\nCheck the item’s original listing date: If it’s been listed for a long time, the seller might be more flexible on the price\nUse your Best Offers wisely: We limit the number of Best Offers you can make on each item, we'll let you know when you're using your last one. Expired, declined, and retracted offers all count toward this limit\nResponding to an offer from a seller\nIf you watch an item or add it to your cart, the seller can send you a special offer for that item. If you receive an offer, you’ll get an email and a message in My eBay - opens in new window or tab . If you select Review offer in this message, you can review and respond to the offer.\nIf you'd like to accept the offer, select Go to checkout to complete your purchase. Keep in mind that until you pay for the item, the item will still be available to other buyers and the seller can change their mind at any time. If you’re not interested in the offer, select Decline offer .\nYou can also make a counteroffer if you'd like to negotiate a better price. Here's how:\nSelect Make a counteroffer .\nAdd your amount (this doesn’t include shipping).\nIf you like, you can add a message for the seller.\nSelect Review , then select Send .\nThe seller can then accept your counteroffer, decline it, or send you a counteroffer. You can send a maximum of 4 counteroffers to the seller.

They can choose Shop and ship separately to have their payment process automatically 1 hour after winning an auction, or choose Shop more, ship together to delay payment up to 7 days, to allow more time to combine shipping. Buyers can still choose to check out manually at any time.\nIn an auction-style listing, sellers name a starting price and you bid against other buyers. You can keep track of your bidding from the Bids/Offers - opens in new window or tab section of My eBay . When the listing ends, the highest bidder wins the auction and pays for the item.\nYou may be asked to provide a payment method and shipping address when making a bid. In this case, if you win the auction, payment will be taken automatically. This is to ensure smoother transactions for buyers and sellers.\nTip Remember, a bid is a binding contract. When you bid on an item in an auction, you're committing to buy it if you win.\nOur articles below will help answer any questions you have about auctions and tell you everything you need to know about how to bid on items.\nStay ahead of the competition by setting up automatic bidding.\nFind out how and when you can retract a bid if you make a mistake while bidding.\nDiscover how reserve prices on auctions work.\nIf you aren't the winning bidder on an auction the seller may still send you a Second Chance Offer.

There will be a note on these listings stating that they're private, and that only the seller can see your username.\nThe seller may have ended the listing early – although this is something we strongly discourage. Or, if the seller breached one of our policies, we may have had to cancel the listing.\nSellers sometimes set requirements for potential buyers based on their payment or shipping preferences. For example, some sellers may not ship to the country or area where you live.\nIf that happens, you'll see a message asking you to contact the seller when you try to place a bid. Let them know you'd like to bid, and they may change their requirements to allow you to take part.\nIt's important to us that auctions are always fair and honest. Sometimes a member who knows the seller – perhaps a family member or friend – bids on an item to drive up the price. This is known as shill bidding and isn't allowed on eBay."

This can range from the same working day, to up to 30 business days from when you placed the order. If you order late in the day or over the weekend, handling will usually take a little longer\nShipping or courier services: Most sellers offer a variety of delivery options, so you can choose the service you prefer when you're checking out – bearing in mind that some services may take longer than others\nItem location and shipping address: We'll take into account how far the item has to travel overall (including any international shipping), and whether delivery is to a metro or rural area\nCleared payment: Once the order is confirmed, the seller can ship the item. However, sometimes the seller may wait until the payment is in their account before they send your item\nTip If you need to get your item urgently, check to see if your seller offers an express delivery option.\nWeekend delivery\nWhether an item can be delivered during the weekend depends on the shipping options provided by the seller. An item's expected delivery date is based on working days, so weekends and public holidays aren't included in that calculation.\nIf the seller doesn't offer weekend delivery, you can contact them to ask if it's possible. If the seller agrees to your request, you may have to pay additional shipping fees.\nFree shipping\nIf you see a free shipping message in a listing, you can expect to receive your item within 4 business days and you won't be charged for delivery. You'll see free 1, 2, 3, or 4 day shipping in the listing, as well as the date you can expect to get your order by."

Here's how:\nGo to your Purchase history - opens in new window or tab and find the order you want to cancel.\nSelect the More actions dropdown menu and select Cancel this order .\nSelect Submit .\nWe'll send your request to the seller and ask them to accept or decline the cancellation within 3 calendar days. If the seller accepts, we'll then send a confirmation of cancellation to both your registered email address and your eBay Messages - opens in new window or tab .\nTip You won't be able to cancel an order if you've already reported that the item didn't arrive or if you've requested a return.\nIf the seller declines your cancellation request, or if they've already shipped your item, you'll need to wait until you receive the item and then request a return . If your order wasn't canceled and you haven't received the item, you can report that the item hasn't arrived once the estimated delivery date has passed.\nYou can find more information in our Order cancellation policy ."

You might also get a shipping discount because the seller saves money by combining items. \nHelp webpage content: Are you a seller looking to offer combined shipping? Read our article on offering combined shipping\nIf you’ve already paid for a number of items you ordered from the same seller, and the packages haven’t been marked as shipped, the seller may still be able to combine shipping if you ask them.\nStarting October 2024, some buyers will begin to see a Timing option when they place a bid on items that are eligible for combined shipping. They can choose Shop and ship separately to have their payment process automatically 1 hour after winning an auction, or choose Shop more, ship together to delay payment up to 7 days, to allow more time to combine shipping. Buyers can still choose to check out manually at any time.\nHow to combine shipping\nMany sellers automatically combine shipping if you’re buying multiple items from them. All you need to do is add the items you want to buy to your cart and you’ll see the combined shipping total at checkout.\nTip If the shipping section of the listing doesn’t specify shipping costs for additional items, you’ll need to ask the seller before you pay. If the seller agrees to ship the items in one package, they’ll send you a combined invoice detailing all the items and the new cost of shipping."

Read our article on canceling bids and managing buyers\nWhenever you place a bid, you're agreeing to buy the item if you win the auction. However, in some situations you can retract your bid.\nRetract a bid\nKeep in mind that you can't always retract a bid once it's made. Bids on items listed in Trading Cards categories, for example, can't be retracted. If you're not able to retract your bid, you can also try contacting the seller to see if they'll cancel your bid for you. The decision to cancel is at the discretion of the seller.\nWhen you can retract a bid\nYou can retract a bid if (Note: these options are only applicable for up to 1 hour after making the bid when the listing is ending in less than 12 hours):\nThe seller significantly changed the description of the item\nYou accidentally bid the wrong amount. For example, you meant to bid $20, not $200. In this case, enter the price you intended to bid as soon as you've retracted the incorrect bid\nAny other bids can't be retracted, but you can still contact the seller to see if they'll agree to cancel a bid for you. Remember, the seller isn't obligated to cancel the bid so they may not agree.\nTip When bidding, always double-check that you've entered the correct amount – especially when making a last minute bid."

We’ll bid in increments on your behalf to keep you in the lead but only up to your limit.\nWe’ll let you know if someone outbids you and you can decide if you want to increase your maximum limit.\nKeep in mind when you’re deciding on the maximum amount you’d like to pay that you’ll need to pay the cost of shipping too.\nTip Bidding on items can be exciting, but it is a contractual obligation. When deciding your maximum bid, be sure you’re happy to pay that amount if you win the auction.\nWhy was I immediately outbid?\nIf you are outbid immediately after placing a bid, it’s likely that another bidder is using automatic bidding and has a maximum limit higher than yours. You’ll need to increase your maximum limit in order to be the highest bidder.\nBid increments\nWhen someone else places a bid, we’ll place a slightly higher bid on your behalf. The amount the bid increases by is known as a bid increment. Bid increments are smaller when the bid price is low and larger in higher price brackets.\nOccasionally you’ll see bids increase by less. This means that someone else placed a bid slightly higher than your automatic bid amount."

International sellers can send items to you through regular shipping services, or they may use one of eBay's shipping programs. \nHelp webpage content: Are you a seller looking to sell internationally? Read our article on Selling internationally\nWhen purchasing from an international seller, keep in mind that shipping can sometimes take longer and cost more than buying from a seller in your own country. If you have any questions about shipping, contact the seller before you go to checkout.\nWhere to find the cost of international shipping\nYou'll find the estimated cost of shipping in the Shipping and payments section of every eBay listing. You'll also see the shipping service the seller offers and where the item will be sent from, as well as a list of countries the seller ships to.\nListings also include an estimate of customs and import charges, if applicable. The charges you see on the listing aren't final until you pay for the item at checkout. For example, if you change your delivery address during checkout, or if the applicable import rules change before you complete your payment, the charges could change.\nThe final cost you'll need to pay to have your item delivered will be confirmed at checkout.\nBuying from sellers using eBay International Shipping\nIf your seller is shipping your item through eBay International Shipping, you'll pay for postage at checkout. You can choose to pay for customs charges, import fees and taxes either at checkout or when your item arrives. You'll see the following options at checkout:\nPay import charges now – select this option to pay all taxes and duties at checkout\nDefer import charges until delivery – select this option to pay all taxes and duties when your item arrives\nIf you complete checkout and pay for more than one item from the same seller, the shipping will automatically be combined if the items are eligible. If you're paying import charges at checkout for some items in your order and paying import charges on delivery for other items, your shipping won't be combined. Combined shipping is also not available for auction-style listings.\nOnce you've completed checkout, the seller will send your package to the shipping hub, and from there it's shipped to you. Tracking is automatically added so you can track your order from the hub to your door.\nItems sent by eBay International Shipping can be returned up to 30 days from the delivery date. If you need to return an item, go to our Return an item for a refund page.\nTip International purchases are covered by eBay Money Back Guarantee as long as all other eligibility requirements are met. Learn more about eBay Money Back Guarantee .\nBuying from sellers using the Global Shipping Programme\nIf your seller is in the UK, they may send your item through the Global Shipping Programme. If they're using GSP, you'll see the Global Shipping Programme logo on the listing.\nBenefits of the Global Shipping Programme for buyers:\nYou'll pay all shipping, taxes, and import charges up front, and you won't have to pay any extra charges when your item is delivered\nTracking is always included so you can track your item right to your door\nInternational deliveries made through GSP include customs clearance so you don't need to handle any extra paperwork\nOnce you've paid for your item, the seller sends it to the global shipping center. From there, it's sent to you. When you pay, your payment will be split into two transactions:\nThe first payment goes to the seller to cover the item price and any domestic shipping costs to send the item to the global shipping center\nThe second payment covers the international shipping cost and any import charges, if applicable\nAfter you've completed payment, you'll be able to see both the total cost and the amounts paid to the seller and the global shipping provider on the Order details page.\nTip Items purchased through GSP can't be delivered to P.O. Box numbers or APO and FPO addresses.\nBuying from sellers using other shipping services\nIf your seller sends your item through an international shipping service instead of an eBay shipping program, you'll pay for the cost of delivery and VAT, if it applies, at checkout.\nHowever, you may still have to pay any necessary customs, duties, and import fees when your item arrives. Either your seller or their international shipping service will manage the customs forms.\neBay is partnering with third-party carriers to provide affordable international shipping services for items that fit certain eligibility criteria. Buyers with a shipping address in Mexico can select international shipping with Estafeta - opens in new window or tab , and buyers with a shipping address in China can select HDB International Shipping Services - opens in new window or tab when purchasing eligible items.\nCustoms and import charges\nAs a buyer, it's your responsibility to check which customs and import charges may apply, and to pay them. These import charges are generally based on the item's price, weight, dimensions, and country of origin, as well as any taxes, duties, and fees added by your country.\nYour seller might be able to give you some information about import charges, but before you bid on, or buy an item, it's a good idea to check with your country's customs office for more specific details.\nImport charges include\nSales, goods, and services\nValue added taxes\nDuties\nTariffs\nExcise taxes\nOther amounts assessed or levied by any government authority in connection with the importation of goods into the applicable country of importation\nThird party brokerage fees (including advancement and disbursement charges as well as customs brokers’ handling and filing fees)\nPenalties\nClassification charges associated with the assignment of a Harmonized System (HS) classification code\nCharges for export compliance screening and verification and the assignment of an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN)\nCharges relating to the management of variances between the quoted import charges and actual costs\nImport charges are in addition to the customs duties and taxes imposed by country tax and customs officials.\nImporting items into the United States\nIf you are importing a high value item into the United States, the shipping carrier may reach out to you directly for more information. This is because U.S. Customs has asked the carrier to provide it with your tax ID number. A tax ID number is typically a social security number or an employee ID number.\nIt's important to respond to the carrier's request promptly so that shipping is not delayed. If U.S. Customs does not have the information it requested, the carrier will be unable to import the item.\nTip When you're buying items from overseas, there may be restrictions on certain items in your country.

If you don’t have a tripod, place the camera on a flat surface and use the shutter timer to eliminate excess motion\nAvoid using a flash, which can cause shadows, reflections, hot spots and greyness\nPhotos need to be at least 500 pixels on the longest side but we recommend you aim for 800-1600 pixels on the longest side. Our photo uploader can take images up to 7MB in size\nCapture images of the top, bottom and sides of your item with detailed close-ups. Also, include photos that clearly show any flaws, scratches or other imperfections\nDon’t overlay text such as “Free postage” or seller logos. That kind of information should go in the title, subtitle, or item description\nYou can’t use a catalog or stock photo if you’re listing an item as used\nTip In some categories, image quality isn’t as critical to a sale as others. Items in Vehicle Parts & Accessories; Cars, Bikes, Boats; Books; and Tickets may be exempt from some of the photo requirements.\nProblems when adding photos\nIf you’re having trouble adding photos, make sure you’re using one of the accepted file formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, WEBP, HEIC, or AVIF). Also check each file size is no larger than 7MB each. If you’re copying from a web address, the photo can be 12MB.\nOther tips:\nUse the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari\nClear your browser’s cache (refer to the browser’s help section if you don’t know how)\nIf you’re using pop-up blocking software on your browser, the photo uploader might not appear. Try temporarily disabling pop-up blockers (refer to the browser’s help for instructions)\nMake sure your image hasn’t expired or been archived. eBay stores pictures for 90 days\nGallery Plus\nWith Gallery Plus, you listing's main image will show in search results with a larger picture.\nGallery plus offers:\nA larger picture, up to 400 x 400 pixels, when you hover over the item in search results. Otherwise, your picture is shown at the standard size of 96 pixels\nA magnifying glass and Enlarge link\nAccess to all of your pictures in search results, if you have multiple pictures"

Depending on whether they’ve already purchased an item from you, or have just bid on one of your listings, you’ll be able to contact them in slightly different ways. \nHelp webpage content: Are you a buyer looking to contact a seller? See our article on contacting a seller .\nHow to contact someone who bought an item from you\nOnce someone's bought an item from you, you can contact them directly. Select the button below and we'll walk you through the steps.\nContact a buyer\nYou can also contact the buyer using their Buyer Alias Email Address which you can find in the View order details page.\nHow to contact a bidder who hasn't yet won your auction\nIf you need to get in touch with a bidder while an auction's still under way, we won't be able to give you their contact details, but you can send them a message.\nTime to respond\nTime to respond is the average time it takes for you to respond to a question from a potential buyer viewing your listing.\nWhen the buyer chooses the option to contact you, they may see an indication of when they can expect to hear from you. For example, they may see:\nResponds within 1 hour\nResponds within 3 hours\nResponds within 6 hours\nResponds within 12 hours\nResponds within 24 hours\nResponds within 48 hours\nTip Your time to respond does not impact your seller rating in any way, and there are no plans to add this as a criterion to qualify as a Top Rated Seller.\nHow is my Time to respond calculated?\nYour response time is calculated based on data over the last 12 months; here's how it works:\nTo be included in the calculation, you must have received at least 1 question, and answered over 60%+ questions over the last 12 months\nOnly the first question and response from each conversation are included.\nThe result is rounded up to the nearest number from the list of time frames mentioned above\nIf your typical response time is more than 48 hours, your time to respond will not be shown\nIf you have working days/hours set for the purposes of shipping cut offs, these are not taken into consideration, however they may be in the future\nAuto-generated responses are considered in the calculation\nOnly messages sent via eBay messages will be factored into this calculation. Responses to offers are not factored into the calculation, nor are messages sent via “send message” in the Best Offer flow\nAs your time to respond is calculated over 12 months, occasional fluctuations in response time (such as when you're sick, away, or unable to respond as quickly as you usually do) will not considerably impact your overall performance evaluation.\nHow to share your phone number with buyers\nYou can also make your phone number available to buyers so they can contact you by phone before and/or after they've bought from you. You'll need to opt in before you can share your number though. Here's how:\nGo to Account and select Manage communications with buyers - opens in new window or tab .\nFind Share your phone number. If Yes is showing, you're opted in and buyers can see your phone number. Go to step 3 to choose whether you want to show your phone number before and/or after a buyer has bought from you. If No is showing and you want to opt in, select Edit .\nOn the Manage your Q & A for buyers page, select Share your phone number . Choose between Only show this info after a purchase or Show this info both before and after a purchase.\nSelect Submit . You're now opted in and buyers can access your phone number.\nWhen you're opted in, buyers can find your phone number in 3 places on eBay:\nIf the buyer selects Other on the Find answers page when they choose Contact seller , they see an option to view your phone number.\nIf the buyer continues to the contact form from the Find answers page, they see an option to view your phone number at the bottom of the page.\nIf your buyer responds to an email you sent them, they see an option to view your phone number at the bottom of the page.\nOne of our top priorities is protecting our members so we don't allow contact information to be used to complete sales off our site. When this happens, it poses a risk of fraud and buyers and sellers aren't covered by our protection programs if something goes wrong. If a buyer asks you to complete a transaction outside of eBay, please contact us to let us know.\nRead our policies on False or missing contact information and Offers to buy and sell outside of eBay for more information.\nHow to contact a buyer through Email\nFor privacy reasons, eBay is no longer displaying personal email addresses. However, you can still contact the buyer through email using their \"Buyer Alias Email Address\" which you can find in the View order details page.\nThis email alias, ending in @members.ebay.com, is unique to your communications with this buyer. You can also give email aliases to shipping carriers, so that they can securely share shipping updates with the buyer.\nMessages sent using eBay alias addresses go through our secure servers before reaching a members registered email address and their eBay Messages. eBay email alias addresses support PDF, DOC, TXT, JPG, GIF, JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF attachments up to a maximum size of 10 MB.\nFor more information see our Member-to-member contact policy ."

You can:\nAccept the Best Offer and end the listing\nRespond with a counteroffer\nLet the offer expire. This will happen automatically after 24 hours or when the listing ends, whichever comes first\nDecline the offer\nIn most cases, when using the Best Offer option in a listing, buyers are required to make immediate payment. However, some buyers may be asked to confirm their payment and shipping details when they're making an offer.\nIf you're happy to accept offers from all buyers, without immediate payment, go to your Buyer Management settings and uncheck the box next to Buyer Payment Requirements.\nHow to make a counteroffer\nWhen you make a counteroffer, your response should be lower than the Buy It Now price, but higher than the offer you received.\nYou can respond directly to the potential buyer from the message we send you letting you know about the buyer's Best Offer.\nYou might receive offers from multiple buyers, and making counteroffers to each is perfectly fine. Each counteroffer expires after 24 hours, and whoever accepts your counteroffer first wins.\nAutomatic responses to a Best Offer\nIf you set up automatic responses in your listing, we can accept or decline a Best Offer for you, based on the price limits you select. Buyers won't know your limits, but the upper limit must be below your Buy It Now price.\nHere's how automatic responses work:\nWhen you get an offer at, or above, your upper limit, we automatically send an email to you and the buyer saying that you've accepted and the buyer should pay\nWhen you get an offer below your lower limit, we automatically send an email to the buyer declining the offer. The buyer can submit a higher bid or you can send a counteroffer.

After this click, you updated the ad rate to 8%. When you receive a Best Offer from that buyer, you see a 15% ad rate displayed instead of your current ad rate of 8%.

Always be careful if a seller asks for your personal contact details, such as an email address or phone number.

This is against our policy , and your purchase wouldn't be covered by eBay Money Back Guarantee\nUnsafe payment methods: We don't allow some payment methods on eBay, because the payment can't be traced or recovered if there's a problem.

There are two ad rate strategies you can choose from: fixed or dynamic.\nA dynamic bidding strategy will automatically update your ad rates daily to the suggested ad rate. With this strategy, you do not need to make daily, manual updates to keep your ad rates competitive in the marketplace.\nSuggested ad rates are calculated based on a variety of factors that may include item attributes, seasonality, past performance, and current competition in order to find an optimal balance between performance and cost.\nA fixed ad rate is consistent and will not change once it’s set. You can edit your ad rates any time during your campaign.\nGeneral campaign ad fees\nYou are only charged for items promoted with the general campaign strategy when a buyer clicks on your promoted listing ad and purchases any of your promoted items within 30 days. (A click is when a buyer clicks through to your item page from your ad, or clicks the Add to Watchlist heart symbol on your ad.) This means you only pay when you sell.\nThe fee you are charged is based on the ad rate you set for each listing. An ad rate is a percentage of an item's total sale amount (including shipping and any other applicable fees or taxes).\nHere's how the fees work:\nYou choose an ad rate between 2% - 100% of the item's total sale amount. The higher the ad rate, the higher the possibility of ad placement, leading to increased visibility\nDynamic ad rates are aligned with the daily suggested ad rate, which is calculated based on a variety of factors such as item attributes, seasonality, past performance and current competition for each of your listings\nYou will only be charged when a buyer clicks on your promoted listing and purchases any of your promoted items within 30 days of the click\nThe ad fee is based on the ad rate you chose and the total sale amount (including item price, shipping, taxes and any other applicable fees)\nAd fees are shown in your Payments tab - opens in new window or tab in Seller Hub, or the transactions page in My eBay\nTip Visit the Seller Center - opens in new window or tab to learn more about promoting your listings with the general strategy.\nMonitoring your campaigns\nAdvertising and Campaign dashboards\nOnce you have activated a campaign, you can view the performance of all of your Promoted Listings campaigns from the Advertising dashboard - opens in new window or tab .\nYour Campaign dashboard let you see listing-level reporting for each individual campaign. While on the Campaign dashboard you can make edits quickly within the context of your performance.

We define the sale of a promoted item that is different from the item originally featured in the ad that the buyer clicked on as a Halo Item sale. A Direct Sale is when a buyer purchases the same item that was featured in the general ad they originally clicked on within 30 days.\nFor Halo Item sales, you will only be charged an ad fee if the purchased item is actively promoted with the general strategy in any campaign at the time of the sale, and you will be charged the ad rate of the sold item. For Direct Sales, we measure the 30-day sales attribution window from the click closest to the sale and charge based on the ad rate in effect at the time of that last click.\nThe ad fee for Halo Item sales will be calculated based on the ad rate in effect for the sold item at the time of the sale.\nWhat happens if I accept a Best Offer for a promoted item?\nIf you accept a Best Offer from a buyer who clicked on one of your listings promoted with the general strategy within the last 30 days, you'll be charged an ad fee based on the final total sale amount (including item price, shipping, taxes and any other applicable fees).\nIf the ad rate displayed for the Best Offer is not your current ad rate, the buyer may have clicked on your ad within the last 30 days prior to you making ad rate edits.\nExample: Within the last 30 days, a buyer clicked on an ad that you created with a 15% ad rate. After this click, you updated the ad rate to 8%. When you receive a Best Offer from that buyer, you see a 15% ad rate displayed instead of your current ad rate of 8%. This is due to your ad rate being 15% at the time the buyer clicked on your ad.\nThe ad rate you're charged may be different than the ad rate displayed for a Best Offer if:\nThe buyer clicked on your ad again before purchasing or placed a different offer for the same item. In this case, the ad rate selected closest to the time of sale will be applied\nYour ad was clicked before any ad rate changes were made\nThe item being purchased is a Halo Item where the ad rate is based on the settings at the time of the sale\nThe buyer purchases a different promoted item of yours\nWhere do Promoted Listings ads appear?\nPromoted Listings may appear in prominent placements across the eBay network, including the search results page and product pages.\nThe eBay network is a group of sites where your promoted listings could be featured, including eBay and partner sites across the internet.\nYour promoted listings may appear in sponsored placements off eBay, including search engines, to help drive traffic to your listings when buyers are actively searching and shopping across the internet.\nBy default, all listings in general campaigns are eligible to appear in external sponsored placements. Those ads may preempt other eBay-funded marketing efforts we may take on your behalf.\nIf you would like your general ads to appear on eBay only, you can submit a request to opt out of off eBay placements - opens in new window or tab . You can expect to be opted out 7 days after submitting a request. If you would like to opt back in, you can submit a request through the same form above.\nYou may still see \"Promoted Listings sales (via external placements)\" in your downloadable reports after you've opted out due to our 30-day attribution window. For example, if a buyer clicked on your promoted listing before you opted out, then returned to purchase your listing after you opted out and within 30 days of that click, you would still be charged the ad rate in effect at the time of the click.\nCan listings be promoted on multiple eBay sites?\nTo promote listings on another eBay site (e.g. ebay.co.uk), log in to that eBay site and create campaigns using that site's local Promoted Listings tools.\nHow do I find out how specific listings are performing?\nYou can view listing-level sales data from your Campaign dashboard to understand how specific items are performing.\nCampaign dashboards are currently available for all general campaigns created using simple or bulk listing selection. From your campaign dashboard, you can see detailed listing-level reporting and make edits quickly.\nYou'll find your campaign dashboard by going to your Advertising dashboard and selecting the campaign name from your campaign grid.\nWhy is my campaign performance increasing/decreasing even though I haven't made any changes?\"\nThe eBay Marketplace is a dynamic environment. A number of factors can cause an increase or decrease in your Promoted Listings, clicks, or sales. They include:\nBuyer traffic or demand for a certain item\nSeasonality\nChanges to the competitive landscape (e.g., other sellers start or stop promoting items in the same category and/or make significant changes to their CPC bids)\nThird parties, such as a brand manufacturer, choosing to start or stop promoting certain items\nGeneral platform improvements, quality thresholds, and routine testing\nWhat are the available selections in the condition filter?\nThere are eight selections from the Condition filter when adding listings to your campaigns. See the below groupings to see the item conditions that are included within these consolidated selections.\n“New\" including: New New with tags New with box Brand new Digital good\nNew\nNew with tags\nNew with box\nBrand new\nDigital good\n\"New other\" including New other (see details) / open box New without tags New without box New other (see details) New - open box New with defects\nNew other (see details) / open box\nNew without tags\nNew without box\nNew other (see details)\nNew - open box\nNew with defects\nCertified refurbished\nExcellent - refurbished\nVery good - refurbished\nGood - refurbished\n\"Seller Refurbished\" including: Seller refurbished Remanufactured Retread Certified pre-owned\nSeller refurbished\nRemanufactured\nRetread\nCertified pre-owned\n\"Used\" including:\nUsed\nPre-owned\nLike new\nGraded\nVery good\nGood\nAcceptable\nFor parts or not working\nDamaged\nUngraded\nHow does using a rule to select listings work with listings that have variations in pricing?\nWhen using rules to select listings, we consider the prices of all variations. If any of these prices fall outside the selected price range, the listing will be excluded, even if there are variations that meet the set criteria available.\nFor example, if you have a listing with three different prices for three different colors ($8, $10, $12). You set your price range filter as $10 - $100. This listing would not be included because the lowest price for the listing ($8) does not meet your price range criteria ($10 - $100).\nWhat happens to my Promoted Listings when I relist a Buy It Now item?\nWhen you relist a Buy It Now item, whether manually or automatically, the Promoted Listings status is carried over to the new listing.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Page views \nHelp webpage description: Page views track how many times eBay users have looked at your listings, which helps you understand how your listings are performing. \nHelp webpage content: eBay provides you with the number of page views each of your listings has received. You can also view a Listing traffic history report for each of your listings which can help you spot trends and understand how they're performing.\nWant to keep an eye on an item you're interested in buying? See our help page on using your Watchlist .\nWhat counts as a page view?\nA page view is counted when someone views your listing on the eBay website or mobile app\nIf someone views your listing, clicks away, and then comes back to the listing, that counts as a second view\nIf someone views your listing and then refreshes the page, each refresh counts as a view\nWhat doesn’t count as a page view?\nWhen a link to your listing appears on eBay, such as in a search result or ad placement, but the user doesn't click on it to view it\nWhen you’re logged in to eBay and you view your own listing\nWhen your listing is viewed by a bot\nTip A listing can have more Watchers than page views. This is because buyers can add your listing to their Watch list directly from the eBay search results page, without viewing it.\nHow machine or bot traffic is removed from your listings\neBay strives to filter as much bot traffic as possible from page view data, but there’s a chance that a small amount of bot traffic is included.\nBot filtering is done in two stages:\nBot traffic is identified and removed from your page view count in near real-time\nA secondary filtering process performs a deeper analysis on a daily basis and removes bot traffic that may not have been caught by the initial filtering. (This can cause your page views to decrease)\nWhere to find your listing page views\nYou can find your listing page views in the following places:\nActive and Unsold pages in the eBay app, in My eBay - opens in new window or tab , and in Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab\nOn the listing page itself on the eBay app and website (when you’re logged into your account)\nOn the Review your traffic page on the Seller Hub Performance tab - opens in new window or tab\nIn Promoted Listings campaigns in your Advertising dashboard - opens in new window or tab under Marketing (the Advertising dashboard uses the term ‘Clicks’ instead of page views)\nTip Page view data on your listings is not visible to other users. This information is only visible to you.\nTime period for the page view count\nThe time period for the page view count displayed beside your active and unsold listings can differ depending on whether your listing is an auction or fixed price listing.\nAuction listings\nFor an active auction listing, the view count shows the total number of views since the auction started.\nFor an auction listing that ended, the view count shows the total number of views from the current time going back 30 days. This means the view count for an ended listing will include views made after the auction ended. This can happen in a number of ways such as a person doing a search on eBay for Sold or Completed listings.\nFixed price listings\nFor an active fixed price listing that’s less than 30 days old, the view count shows the total number of views since the listing started.\nFor a fixed price listing that’s been active for more than 30 days, the view count is a rolling 30-day count which can increase or decrease. This rolling 30-day count is different from a cumulative lifetime view count, which only increases.\nThere are two main reasons why the 30-day view count can decrease.\nOnce a day, the counts from the first day in the 30-day window are removed, while the counts for the next day start accumulating.\nAfter the daily bot filtering process, the count can go down if bot traffic is detected and removed.\nTo analyze views over longer time periods, use the Listing traffic history report.\nListing traffic history report\nIn most places where you see the page view number for an active listing, you can click on that number to see a Listing traffic history report. This report allows you to see the page views for the listing over time, and makes it easy for you to see trends.\nIf the listing has been active long enough, you'll have the option of changing the time period, going back as far as two years.\nIf the listing is promoted via Promoted Listings, the report also includes a breakdown between page views that come from Promoted Listings ads, and views that don't come from ads."

Once you reply, your comment will appear directly below the buyer’s feedback comment.\nSend a feedback revision request to your buyer\nYou can only request a revision for feedback that is less than 30 days old. You can make 5 feedback revision requests per calendar year.\nTip For every 1,000 feedback ratings you receive during the year, you can make 5 additional feedback revision requests.

Please see our articles:\nLeaving feedback for sellers\nLeaving feedback for buyers\nEach time you buy or sell something, you have an opportunity to leave feedback about your experience. Feedback consists of a positive, negative, or neutral rating, along with a short comment and the option to upload up to 5 images. Feedback helps buyers and sellers build their reputation on eBay and this is why \"verified purchase\" is displayed next to feedback. This information is available in each member's feedback profile, and helps eBay users buy and sell with confidence.\nIf you’ve recently left feedback and you’d like to change it, you can find out how to add follow-up comments or request a feedback revision in our article on viewing and changing feedback left for sellers .\nViewing a feedback profile\nYou can view a member’s feedback profile - including your own - by selecting the number in brackets next to their username. This number is their current feedback score.\nOn the feedback profile page, you'll see a member’s:\nOverall feedback score\nPercentage of positive ratings\nRecently received feedback (including comments and images)\nDetailed seller ratings\neBay registration date\nYou can also find a link to contact the member, and if the member is a seller, a link to view other items they are selling.\nTip Once you reach a feedback score of 10, you’ll earn a yellow star which is displayed on your profile. As your feedback score increases, the star changes color, all the way to a silver shooting star for a score above 1,000,000.\nMaking your feedback public or private\nWe strongly encourage everyone to keep all their feedback information public. It helps you earn the trust of other eBay members, increasing the likelihood that they’ll trade with you.\nIf you want to sell on eBay, your feedback must be visible to everyone.\nIf you choose to make your feedback private, you won’t be able to sell items on eBay and the feedback you’ve left and received will be hidden from other members. However, your overall number of positive, neutral, and negative feedback ratings will still be displayed.\nHere’s how to change who can see your feedback:\nGo to your feedback profile - opens in new window or tab .\nScroll down to the All received Feedback section and set the toggle to either Visible to everyone or Hide .\nFrequently asked questions\nMy trading partner won't leave me feedback. What should I do?\nIf you've successfully completed a transaction with another eBay member and they haven't left you feedback, it's fine to send a message as a reminder. Remember though, leaving feedback is completely voluntary.\nContact a buyer\nContact a seller\nI received negative feedback that I don't think is fair. What can I do?\nYou can respond to the feedback and tell your side of the story. As a seller, you can also send a limited number of requests for buyers to revise their feedback .\nI received feedback that violates eBay policies. What should I do?\nIf a member has violated one of our feedback policies , you can ask us to have it removed . Once we review it, we may remove the entire feedback, or just the element that violates the policy, i.e. the comment, image or rating.\nCan I change feedback I left for someone else?\nIn most cases you can't change feedback once you've submitted it. However, if you left negative or neutral feedback for a seller and want to change it to positive feedback, the seller may be able to send you a feedback revision request. If the seller is unable to send a feedback revision request, you can leave a clarifying follow up comment to your original feedback."

We’ll remove special characters (such as apostrophes, spaces, &, !, $, etc.), add hyphens between words, and make all letters lowercase.\nFor example, if you name your eBay Store “Fine Jewelry!,” your store URL will be: https://www.ebay.com/str/fine-jewelry.\nHere are some things to keep in mind when deciding upon your eBay Store name:\nIt can be your eBay username as long as it meets the requirements above\nIt must start and end with a letter or number\nIt can’t start with four or more consecutive letter A s\nIt can’t start with an e or E followed by more than a single number\nIt can’t contain the following characters: <, >, or @\nIt can’t be the username of another eBay member\nIt can’t contain “www” anywhere in the name\nIt can’t contain two or more consecutive spaces or non-alphanumeric characters\nIt can’t end with a top-level domain abbreviation used on the internet such as .com, .co.uk, .net, etc.\nIt can’t be a name that is identical or confusingly similar to another company’s name which is protected by trademark law.

That's why we always show an expected delivery date on eBay listings. \nHelp webpage content: Are you a buyer looking for information on when your item will arrive? Read our article on expected delivery dates for items you've bought\nThe estimated delivery date shown on your listings is based on the time it takes you to pack and ship items (your handling time), and the delivery or courier services you offer.\nHandling and dispatch time\nWe define handling time as the time it takes you to hand over the item to the shipping provider after the buyer has paid.\nBuyers want their purchases to arrive quickly so we recommend setting a dispatch time of no more than 2 days. Shorter dispatch times are always better if you can reliably meet them.\nIf you offer 1-day handling, remember the time frame isn't based on 24 hours: it's the end of the next business day. For example, if a buyer pays for your item on Monday, it needs to be scanned by Tuesday, 11:59pm.\nIf an item is bought on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, it needs to have tracking added by Monday, 11:59pm.\nTip Always make sure to send your items on time or your late delivery rate may be affected.

If they're willing to pay any difference in cost, it's up to you whether to accept their request or not.\nExpress delivery on eBay\nTo appeal to buyers who need items quickly, consider adding express delivery services to your listing, such as overnight, next-day, or same-day delivery.\nTo offer express delivery:\nGo to the Shipping details section when creating a listing.\nChoose your preferred carrier(s) from the Services dropdown menu.\nFree shipping message\nThe free shipping message lets buyers know when they can expect to receive their item and that they won't have to pay for delivery. We'll automatically add a free shipping message to your listings whenever you meet these requirements:\nBoth you and your buyer are located in the 48 contiguous US states\nWe can estimate the item's delivery date as 4 business days or less based on your handling time, the delivery service you've offered, your location, and the buyer's delivery address\nYou offer free shipping as your first (default) shipping option\nYou don't offer local pickup or freight as your first (default) shipping option\nThe listing isn't in Classified Ad format\nHow to qualify for a free shipping message:\nOffer free delivery using a shipping service that will arrive in 4 days or less\nOffer same-day or 1-day handling\nUpload your item's tracking details when using tracked shipping\nIf eBay determines that your listing qualifies and you meet your handling time, we will remove any negative or neutral feedback left by the buyer regarding late delivery\nThis late delivery coverage does not protect your late shipment defects, and your listings can be deactivated from the program if they fall below the performance requirements.\nTip On eBay Motors, the free shipping message is only shown in listings in the Parts & Accessories category.\nSpecifying \"Get it by\" delivery dates\nIf you're confident in your end-to-end delivery time and you'd like more control over the expected delivery dates shown on your listings, you can set up shipping rate tables - opens in new window or tab to show how quickly you can get your items to a customer's door.\nIn your rate tables, you'll specify your shipping costs and delivery speeds by region, based on your handling time plus your shipping carrier's delivery time.

You can then set up rules that automatically apply to the shipping cost when someone buys multiple items.\nDepending on whether you offer a flat shipping rate, or use calculated shipping, these discounts work slightly differently.\nTo check that combined payments are enabled on your account:\nOn the Shipping Preferences - opens in new window or tab page, select Edit beside Allow combined payments and shipping.\nChoose the time period during which you're willing to combine payment for purchased items and select Save .\nFlat rate shipping rules\nIf you're offering a flat rate shipping cost, where all buyers pay the same amount, you can apply two different types of shipping rules:\nAdd a fixed amount for each additional item purchased. For example, if the shipping cost on the first item is $5 you could choose to charge just $2 in shipping for each additional purchase\nSubtract an amount from the shipping charge for each additional item purchased. In the same example as above you could choose to charge $1 less than the initial cost (i.e., $4) for each additional purchase\nTo create a flat shipping rule:\nOn the Shipping Preferences - opens in new window or tab page, select Edit beside Flat shipping rule.\nFrom the dropdown menu, choose whether to add or subtract an amount for each additional item purchased.\nEnter the amount to add/subtract.\nEnter a profile name to give your policy a descriptive name.\nSelect Save .\nCalculated shipping rules\nIf you're offering a calculated shipping cost (where the amount a buyer pays varies based on their location), you can apply rules for combining items into a single package:\nAutomatically combine the weights of all the items in one package. For example, if a buyer purchases three items that weigh 4 lb each, you can set up a rule that charges shipping for a single 12 lb package\nAutomatically combine the weights of the items in one package and subtract a weight amount (in ounces). For example, if a buyer purchases 3 items that weigh 4 lb each, you can set up a rule that combines the items in one 12 lb package, and automatically deducts 16 oz from the total weight\nTo create calculated shipping rules:\nOn the Shipping Preferences - opens in new window or tab page, select Edit beside Calculated shipping rule.\nChoose either Combine all item weights , or Combine all item weights and subtract an amount .\nSelect Next , then specify a rule for your handling costs from the dropdown menu.\nEnter the amount to be added or subtracted for each additional item.\nEnter a profile name to give your policy a descriptive name.\nSelect Save .\nCalculated shipping rules apply only to listings for which you specify both calculated shipping and combined shipping discounts.\nPromotional shipping discount rules\nWhile flat rate and calculated shipping rules are applied when a buyer goes through checkout, you can also use shipping rules as a promotional tool to help attract additional buyers.\nWith promotional shipping discounts, you can create a rule that offers your buyers a discount based on the conditions you set. For example:\nBuyers will be charged no more than $5 for shipping if they buy more than one item\nBuyers will qualify for free shipping if they spend more than $25\nWhen buyers qualify for your promotional shipping discount, the promotional rule takes priority over your existing flat and calculated shipping rules.\nPromotional shipping rules apply to all listings which you've specified have a combined shipping discount.\nBuyers will be able to see these discounts highlighted in your listings.\nTo set up a promotional shipping discount:\nOn the Shipping Preferences - opens in new window or tab page, select Edit beside Promotional shipping rule.\nFill in your conditions and select Save .\nTip Make sure you've applied combined shipping rules to all listings in which you want to offer a discount.\nCarrier-specific discounts\nShipping carrier discounts let you pass some or all of your savings along to your buyers. You have two options for offering carrier discounts to your buyers:\nSet up a flat discount off retail or daily rates for domestic and international shipments across all carriers (USPS, FedEx, and UPS)\nOffer eBay discounted rates with USPS, FedEx, and UPS\nIn either case, the changes you make will be applied to all active and new listings where a shipping cost applies. You can also choose to offer retail rates with no carrier specific discounts by selecting Don’t offer discounted rates to buyers . After saving your preference in shipping discount settings - opens in new window or tab , your updates will be visible to buyers within 24 hours.\nWhen you use eBay labels to ship an item, you only need to pay the shipping cost and the cost of any shipping services you choose, such as signature confirmation. As the exact cost of shipping is detailed, you ensure that the full cost is covered in the sale price to your buyer. However, if you enable these discounts but then go to a carrier retail location to purchase labels (instead of using eBay to print labels), you could end up paying more than the shipping costs charged to your buyer.\nTo set up a flat discount across all carriers:\nOn the Shipping Preferences - opens in new window or tab page, select Edit beside Offer discounts to buyers.\nFill in your discount preferences by selecting Offer eBay discounted rates to buyers or Offer custom discount to buyers .\nSelect Save .\nYou can't specify different discounts for different services. The domestic discount rate applies to shipments to Alaska, Hawaii, US Protectorates, and APO or FPO addresses. To set up eBay discounted rates:\nOn the Shipping Preferences - opens in new window or tab page, select Edit beside Offer carrier-specific discounts for buyers.\nSelect Offer eBay discounted rates to buyers .\nCheck the box beside the eBay discounted rates you wish to offer and then select Save .\nTo opt out of eBay discounted rates, deselect the boxes next to the rates offered and select Save .\nTip See our Seller Center page Shipping Services and Providers - opens in new window or tab for more information on carrier-specific discounts on eBay.\nHow to apply shipping discount rules to your listings\nFor buyers to receive your shipping discounts, you need to apply your rules to the relevant listings. You can do this when creating or editing a listing, or using business policies .\nHere's how to apply a shipping discount rule when listing an item:\nIn the advanced listing tool , go to the Shipping section.\nSelect Apply my promotional shipping rule .\nHere's how to apply a shipping discount rule to an existing listing:\nGo to your Active listings - opens in new window or tab page.\nSelect Revise next to the listing you want to edit.\nIn the Shipping section, select Apply my promotional shipping rule .\nHere's how to apply a shipping discount rule to multiple listings:\nGo to your Business policies - opens in new window or tab .\nSelect the shipping policy you want to edit.\nSelect the rule(s) you want to apply under Combined shipping discounts .\nSelect Save .\nThe shipping discounts will then be applied to all listings with that shipping policy."

        "content": "Help webpage title: Tracking items you've sold \nHelp webpage description: Uploading tracking details after you've sent an item enables you and your buyer to follow its journey, all the way through to delivery. \nHelp webpage content: Are you a buyer looking to track an item? Read our article on tracking an item you bought\nWhen you upload tracking information, you provide your buyer with more confidence that their item will reach them. Buyers are more confident their orders will arrive when they receive regular shipping status updates, and are less likely to file “Item not received” claims. By using one of the shipping carriers integrated with eBay and uploading tracking within your handling time, you're also protecting yourself in case your buyer doesn't receive the item and opens an eBay Money Back Guarantee request.\nIf you use an eBay issued label, the tracking number is provided by one of eBay’s integrated carriers and is automatically uploaded.\nHow to add, edit or delete tracking details\nOnce you've sent your item, you can add tracking details (up to 6 tracking numbers per order) through Seller Hub or My eBay, whether your item was bought by an eBay member or a guest buyer. You can also edit or delete tracking details in the same place. Here's how:\nSeller Hub\nOn the Seller Hub Orders page, go to Paid and shipped - opens in new window or tab and find your order.\nSelect the order by checking the box next to it.\nSelect the Dispatch dropdown menu and then Add tracking number .\nAdd, edit or delete the tracking number and the carrier, then select Save .\nThe buyer will then get an email with the order tracking details.\nMy eBay\nGo to the Orders - opens in new window or tab section of My eBay.\nFrom More actions, select Add tracking number .\nAdd, edit or delete the tracking number and the carrier.\nSelect Submit .\nYou can also scan the tracking QR code in your mobile app by selecting Add Tracking Number on the Item page.\nMarking an item as shipped\nAn item will automatically be \"marked as shipped\" if you use an eBay shipping label or manually upload a tracking number. If you sent an item to a buyer using a different method and it is still not showing as shipped, you can manually mark it as shipped:\nIf you're using Seller Hub:\nGo to the Awaiting shipment - opens in new window or tab section of the 'Orders' tab.\nTick the Actions box beside the item you shipped.\nFrom the dropdown menu, select Mark as shipped\nIf you're using My eBay Selling:\nGo to the Selling overview - opens in new window or tab section.\nFind the item you shipped.\nFrom the dropdown menu, select Mark as shipped.\nItem not received requests\nIf a buyer opens an item not received request, and you haven't already uploaded tracking, you will have 3 business days to upload tracking and respond to the buyer. In order to be protected from an \"Item not received\" claim, the tracking must be from one of the shipping carriers integrated with eBay and must show an acceptance scan to prove shipping.\nItem not received requests will close automatically within 24 hours if tracking details show the item has been delivered to the buyer's ZIP code.\nBoth you and the buyer will get an email notification. The buyer will be able to ask eBay to step in within that 24 hours if they still haven't received the item.\nTip If you buy and print labels on eBay, the order tracking number is uploaded automatically, and you could also save money on shipping.\nInternational tracking\nYou can add tracking details for items you're sending internationally in exactly the same way as for domestic orders. With eBay International Shipping , the international tracking is added to your order automatically. If you're not using eBay International Shipping, you'll have to add tracking to the order yourself. Make sure you use a carrier that offers tracking.\nTroubleshooting tracking issues\nIf you experience any issues tracking items you've sold, or if the tracking information on eBay is different from the details displayed on the shipping carrier site, try the following:\nCheck that you've uploaded the correct tracking number. The tracking number on eBay should match the tracking number on the shipping carrier site\nIf the uploaded tracking number is correct, make sure the carrier name and details are also accurate\nCompare the date the order was confirmed and the date the tracking number was uploaded to eBay to see if there is a significant lapse of time. Most shipping companies can only send tracking information during a specific time frame, so tracking information may have been uploaded too late\neBay shipping insurance\nAs a seller, you're responsible for the safe delivery of your items to the buyer, so you should consider purchasing insurance, particularly for high value goods. ShipCover insurance is available when you print a US Postal Service (USPS) shipping label on eBay. You can purchase other types of insurance online. Check with your shipping carrier to find the best coverage.\nYou can include the cost of insurance in your shipping rates, but you can't charge it as a separate cost.\nYou can find more information in our article on shipping insurance - opens in new window or tab ."

Here's how:\nGo to your Purchases - opens in new window or tab and find the item.\nFrom the More actions dropdown menu, select See request details and then Close your request .\nSelect your reason for closing the return from the dropdown, and add details if you want to.\nSelect Confirm .\nIf you had already asked eBay to step in, you'll see 'case' rather than 'request'. You can still close it if things are resolved.\nTip You won't be able to re-open the request once it's closed.\nMisuse of returns\nBuyers may not misuse our returns processes – such as requesting a return and then sending a different item back.

Try the following:\nSearch several times using different terms to describe the item you’re looking for. This will help you understand the current market price\nTry searching using misspelled words, such as “porcelane” instead of “porcelain.” Fewer people will find a listing with a typo\nNote what time the auction ends; this can affect how many other people will bid on it, and whether you’ll be available to bid at the last minute.

If you're getting a refund, it will go back to your original payment method. Refunds are typically available within 3-5 business days.\nHere's what to do:\nFind your order confirmation email. The subject line starts with \"Order Confirmed\".\nSelect View order details in the body of the email.\nSelect Contact seller .\nSelect I haven't received my item yet .\nChoose No, I want to contact the seller .\nFill in the details and then hit Submit .\nYou'll receive a confirmation email once you've created the request, which will include a link to view your request details. You can also check the status of your request by going to View order details in your order confirmation email, then selecting Resolutions .\nWhat to do if you've only received some of the items you've purchased\nIf you bought multiple items from the same seller, but something was missing when your order arrived, you can follow the steps above to report that you didn't receive an item.\nFor sets and bundled items, if something's missing, you need to open a return request instead. For example, if you bought a set of six paintbrushes but only received four, you can return the set for a full refund or the seller may offer to let you keep the ones you received and give you a partial refund.\nYou want to return an item\nMany eBay sellers accept returns if you've changed your mind. Check the listing to see the seller's full return policy, including how long you have to request a return and any other conditions.\nHow to find the seller's return policy\nFind your order confirmation email. The subject line starts with \"Order Confirmed\".\nSelect View order details in the body of the email.\nSelect the description of your item to go to its listing.\nGo to Returns to see the seller's return policy.\nIf the seller states in their return policy that they don't accept returns, you can ask them to see if they'll make an exception.\nIf the item doesn't match the listing description, or if it is faulty or arrived damaged, you may be eligible for eBay Money Back Guarantee . This means that you can return it even if the seller's returns policy says they don't accept returns.\nHow to open a return request\nSelect View order details in your order confirmation email.\nSelect Return item .\nSelect your reason for the return and select Next .\nYou can add a message to the seller and also upload up to 10 photos showing the item's condition.\nSelect Confirm return .\nYou'll receive a confirmation email once you've created the request, which will include a link to view your return details. You can also see the status of your return by going to View order details in your order confirmation email, then selecting Resolutions .\nHow to return multiple items\nHow you request the return depends on how you bought them.\nSets and bundled items – You need to return the whole lot. For example, if you bought a set of paintbrushes, you can't return just one of them.\nMultiples of the same item – You can return some or all of them, but you can only open one return for the order. For example, if you bought five t-shirts from one listing, you can return two, but you won't be able to return the other three later.\nCombined purchases from the same seller – You can return each item individually. For example, you bought three different books from the seller's store and paid for them together at checkout. You need to open a separate request for each book, because they came from different listings.\nHow the seller may respond to your request\nThe seller has 3 business days to get back to you. How they can respond depends on the reason for your return.\nYou changed your mind about an item\nAccept your return request and offer a full refund – You'll return the item and the seller will then issue a full refund – depending on their returns policy, this may or may not include the original shipping cost. Check the seller's return policy in the listing to see who is responsible for return shipping costs .\nIf the returned item is opened, used, damaged, missing parts, or is damaged during return shipping because it wasn't packaged correctly, some sellers might deduct from your refund to cover the loss in the item's value. Learn more about our Condition of returns policy .\nOffer you a partial refund and let you keep the item – This can be a good compromise when the seller doesn't accept returns, but wants to offer you a gesture of goodwill – say if you ordered the wrong thing by accident.\nOffer you a replacement or an exchange – Some sellers may offer the option of returning an item for a replacement or exchange instead of a refund.\nDecline your return request – Sellers can decline your return request if you changed your mind about an item and they stated in the listing that they don't accept returns, or if you missed the seller's deadline to start a return.\nSend you a message – The seller may ask you for some more details about your return request.\nYour item didn't match the listing, or it arrived faulty or damaged\nAccept your return request and offer a full refund – You'll return the item in the same condition in which it was received, and the seller will then issue a full refund, including the original shipping cost. The seller will also pay for return shipping .\nIf the returned item is used, damaged, missing parts, or is damaged during return shipping because it wasn't packaged correctly, the seller might deduct from the refund to cover the loss in the item's value. Learn more about our Condition of returns policy .\nOffer you a partial refund and let you keep the item – This can be a good compromise when you're not completely satisfied with your purchase – for example, if it arrived with a minor scratch – but you're happy to keep it.\nOffer you a replacement or an exchange – Some sellers may offer the option of returning an item for a replacement or exchange instead of a refund.\nSend you a message – The seller may ask you for some more details about your return request.\nSending the item back\nWhen your return request is accepted, we'll send you an email with the subject \"Send the item back\". Make sure you ship the return by the date in this email to avoid any delays or issues in the refund process.\nIf you're responsible for purchasing the return shipping label, make sure you use a tracked service and add the tracking number to your return request. If the item being returned has a total cost of $750 or more, it will need to be returned with a signature confirmation .\nIf the seller provided a return label, you can access your guest account and the label through the order confirmation email. For more information about who pays for return shipping and how to send the item back, see return shipping for buyers .\nThe condition of the returned item is important, so repack it carefully. If you return the item used, damaged or missing parts, or if it gets damaged during return shipping, the seller may deduct an amount from your refund to cover the loss in the item's value. For more information, see our Condition of returned items policy .\nGetting your money back\nMost sellers refund as soon as they get the item back. If the item has been returned to the seller and they haven't given you a refund after 2 business days, you can ask eBay to step in and help.\nRefunds go back to your original payment method and are typically available within 3-5 business days.\nGet help from eBay\nMost of the time if you have an issue with a purchase, the seller will be able to solve it for you. However, we're here to help.\nHere are the main reasons you might ask us to step in and help:\nThe seller hasn't responded to your request after 3 business days\nThe seller responded, but hasn't provided a resolution (for example, they accepted your return request but didn't provide a return shipping label)\nYou returned the item and it's been delivered back to the seller, but they haven't processed a refund after 2 business days\nDon't leave it too long to ask us to step in and help. We'll automatically close a return request if there's been no activity.\nHow to ask eBay to step in\nTo access your request details, you can either:\nFrom your order confirmation email, go to View order details , then select Resolutions\nFrom the email you received when you opened the request, go to See request details\nFrom the request details, simply select Ask eBay to step in and help .\nLearn more about asking eBay for help .\nClose a request\nIf your item arrives, or if you've changed your mind and no longer want to return your item, it's easy to cancel your request.\nTo access your request details, you can either:\nFrom your order confirmation email, go to View order details , then select Resolutions\nFrom the email you received when you opened the request, go to See request details\nFrom the request details, select Close your request and choose your reason from the dropdown menu.\nYou won't be able to re-open the request once it's closed."

If the seller is responsible for the return shipping costs, they'll let you know how they want the item to be sent back to them. Generally, they'll ask you to send the item back using one of the following:\nAn eBay return shipping label: learn how to print an eBay return shipping label\nA label from their preferred carrier: if the seller provides you with a shipping label, they'll send it to you directly, and you can print it from the \"Here's your return shipping label\" email or message that you'll receive in Messages - opens in new window or tab\nThe seller may contact you to make other arrangements, such as returning the item to their store or reimbursing you for return shipping.\nTip If the seller is responsible for return shipping, it's important that they cover the costs.

In some instances, return shipping charges are estimated rather than based on the actual weight of the package. These charges are based on rates eBay negotiated with the USPS and are typically less than what you would pay at the post office for the same item.\nIf the expected shipping charges cost more than the expected refund or the refund value of a replacement or exchange, an eBay return shipping label won't be available.\nOther ways to send the item back\nSometimes returning an item may require additional, alternative shipping arrangements, like adding insurance to your package. Select Examples of alternative shipping arrangements below for more information.\nExamples of alternative shipping arrangements\nShipping a return with insurance: Shipping insurance isn't available on eBay return shipping labels. If you or the seller prefers that an item be returned with insurance, purchase your own return shipping with insurance instead of using the return shipping label provided\nReturning multiple packages: We generally provide one return shipping label for each return requested through My eBay. If you need multiple return shipping labels to ship multiple packages back to the seller, contact the seller to make alternative shipping arrangements for the packages\nThe item is outside USPS guidelines: An eBay return shipping label is only available for items within the USPS size and weight guidelines. Otherwise, you need to make alternative shipping arrangements\nThe item was originally delivered by freight or local pickup: When the seller is responsible for return shipping costs and you need to make alternative shipping arrangements, contact the seller to agree on the service and cost before sending the item. Make sure to include the packing slip and tracking.\nWhen you want to return an item using alternative shipping arrangements, and the seller is responsible for the return shipping charges, you'll need to work with the seller to agree on the shipping service and cost before returning the item.\nIf you use alternative shipping arrangements, the return shipping charges aren't included in any eBay Money Back Guarantee refund you'll receive."

If you're a buyer, we ask that you review and understand our policies, including the eBay User Agreement before you bid on or buy an item. By placing a bid or buying an item, you are agreeing to all of our rules and policies, including the eBay User Agreement.\nOur policies are intended to:\nFollow local laws and regulations\nMinimize risks to buyers and sellers\nMake sure that no one has an unfair advantage\nCreate an enjoyable buying experience\nProtect intellectual property rights\nGuidelines for buyers\nThe abusive buyer policy outlines the type of behavior that we don't allow from buyers-such as making unreasonable demands of a seller, misusing returns, or misusing the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nRules about bidding and paying\nYou can't use eBay if your account contains false contact information . Buyers and sellers sometimes need to be able to get in touch with each other, and we need to be able to contact our members\nYou must pay for any item you commit to buying. Some eBay sellers use an auction-style format, allowing you to bid on an item. Bidding is fun, but keep in mind that each bid you make is a binding contract to buy the item if you win. The same is true for Buy It Now purchases. Not paying for an item after you agree to buy it has negative consequences, explained in our unpaid item policy\nYou can only bid if you really intend to buy the item, even if you're making a non-binding bid . You can only make non-binding bids on certain items, such as real estate and vehicles. This type of bid still means that you intend to buy the item. The bottom line is, don't place a bid unless you mean to buy the item\nYou can't bid on your own item. We call this shill bidding and it not only violates our policies, it's against the law in many places\nBe careful about bidding on several items if you only want one. If you're the winning bidder of more than one auction-style listing, you need to purchase all the items you've won, even if they're the same or similar\nYou can only retract a bid under specific circumstances. For example, if you meant to bid $10.00 but accidentally bid $1,000.00, you can retract the bid. Even then, you need to bid the amount you originally intended immediately. Never use bid retraction to manipulate the bidding process. Bid manipulation is unfair, and it has serious consequences. Learn more about retracting or canceling your bid\nMake sure that you read the listing description before you bid. Many of the problems buyers and sellers encounter are the result of simple misunderstandings about what is for sale and the terms of the sale. For example, some sellers only want to sell to bidders who live in a certain country. Only bid on or buy an item if you can meet the requirements described in the listing. If you bid on an item and you don't meet the seller's requirements, we consider that unwelcome and malicious buying\nIf you know the seller, you can't bid on the item with the intent to increase its price or desirability artificially. This rule applies to family, friends, roommates, employees, and online connections. Buying items from someone just to increase their feedback score or improve their search standing is called shill bidding , and it's against our policies\nYou can't offer to buy items outside of eBay. Our policies don't cover items bought outside of our site. If you buy items outside of eBay, we don't protect you against fraud. Sellers must follow the same rule, so if a seller offers to sell you something outside of eBay, don't accept the offer. For more information, see our rules for everyone , and our policy on offers to buy or sell outside of eBay\nIf you buy an item from a seller in another country, you can't ask the seller to mark the item as a gift in the customs declaration. This is illegal, and against our policies. Learn more about our rules against encouraging illegal activity\nWhen you bid on or buy a vehicle in eBay Motors, we may share your contact information with sellers. Sellers may also contact you about that vehicle or a similar one for sale. Learn more about eBay Motors bidding and our privacy notice\nRules about feedback\nYou can't abuse the feedback system This means you can't threaten to leave a seller negative feedback if that seller won't do something that wasn't promised in the original listing. This is called feedback extortion and is against our policy . Also, you can't leave feedback if you're only doing it to help increase a seller's feedback score. This is a type of feedback manipulation and is also not allowed. Make sure that you understand and follow all of our feedback policies .\nThis means you can't threaten to leave a seller negative feedback if that seller won't do something that wasn't promised in the original listing.

Learn more about what to do if you don't receive an item or it doesn't match the listing description Attempts to manipulate the eBay Money Back Guarantee are prohibited and can have serious consequences.\nAttempts to manipulate the eBay Money Back Guarantee are prohibited and can have serious consequences.\nYou can't try to contact other potential buyers to \"warn\" them about a seller. This is called transaction interference . If you have a concern about a seller's behavior, report it to us and we'll investigate\nIf you're a seller\nIf you're also a seller, please be sure to read our rules for sellers , and make sure that your listings follow our guidelines.\nActivity on eBay is required to follow this policy, the eBay User Agreement and all applicable laws, as well as respect the rights of third parties. If it doesn’t, eBay may take action consistent with applicable laws and the eBay User Agreement , and may even be legally required to do so. Such actions may include, as an example only: Removing the listing or other content, issuing a warning, restricting activity or account suspension.\nReporting policy violations\nIf you want to report a policy violation:\nFirst, read the policy page that deals with the violation (see our rules and policies ) and make sure the other member is really breaking the rules.\nIf you still want to report a member, contact Customer Support .\nReports of policy violations must be specific and you must submit them with the intent of addressing a known or suspected violation of our policy.\nFalse reporting of policy violations can have serious consequences.\nReport a listing only once. Multiple emails about the same listing slow down our investigation.\nWhen we receive your report, we look at all the circumstances, including the member's history, before we decide whether to take action. If we aren't sure about something or can't prove it with certainty, we may not take any action. In addition, we won't discuss the results of an investigation.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Invalid bid retraction policy \nHelp webpage description: We want to ensure a fair marketplace for all our users, so we only allow bids to be retracted under certain circumstances. \nHelp webpage content: A bid is a binding contract that's active until an auction-style listing ends or you're outbid. Once you place a bid, you need to pay for the item if you're the winning bidder. You're not allowed to retract bids to manipulate the bidding process. As honest mistakes sometimes occur, you can only retract a bid if you accidentally bid the wrong amount, or if the seller changes the item description significantly after you have placed your bid. Retracting a bid for any other reason is considered an invalid bid retraction.\nWhat is the policy?\nAllowed\nIt's only OK to retract a bid if:\nYou accidentally enter the wrong amount, like entering $99.50 instead of $9.95. If you do, you need to enter the correct bid right away\nInformation that significantly changed the item description was added after you placed your bid.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Non-binding bid policy \nHelp webpage description: In most product categories on eBay, when you place a bid in an auction it's considered binding – when you win an auction, you're agreeing to complete the purchase. However, there are some categories where bids don't create a formal contract between the buyer and seller. \nHelp webpage content: For motor vehicles and real estate, bids are considered non-binding. When you bid on an item in these categories, you're expressing a strong interest in buying the seller's item, but no formal purchase contract is created if you're the winning bidder. For more details on non-binding bids, please see our full policy guidelines below.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy are bids in these categories non-binding?\nProperties and vehicles are usually high-priced items, and their sale is often both complex and subject to a variety of laws. As such, it will often be necessary for potential buyers and sellers to exchange additional information before completing a transaction.\nRead our full policy\nNon-binding bid policy overview\nA non-binding bid is a bid that shows a buyer's interest in purchasing an item, but it doesn't create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.\nAll bids made in the Real Estate and eBay Motors vehicles categories are considered non-binding.\nRemember, bids placed in any other category are a legal commitment to purchase the item. We strongly encourage you to read the other terms for more information .\nActivity on eBay is required to follow this policy, the eBay User Agreement and all applicable laws, as well as respect the rights of third parties. If it doesn’t, eBay may take action consistent with applicable laws and the eBay User Agreement , and may even be legally required to do so. Such actions may include, as an example only: Removing the listing or other content, issuing a warning, restricting activity or account suspension.\nWhat are the guidelines?\nUsing listings to find buyers who are interested in purchasing your item\nIncluding information about what buyers will need to do next (for example, deposits, transfer paperwork, and transportation options) in your listing\nAdding a reserve price to your listing so that your minimum price is met\nBidding without the intent of completing the purchase\nRetracting a bid on an item that doesn't fall into a non-binding bid category\nBacking out of the transaction due to buyer or seller remorse\nBacking out of the transaction because buyers didn't place a high enough bid and the seller didn't add a reserve price\nStating in the listing that bidding could result in a binding obligation to complete the purchase\nSome examples\nExample of a non-binding bid:\nMary lives in California and is the winning bidder on a car on eBay Motors listed by a dealer in Maryland. Upon checking the paperwork, Mary learns that the car doesn't comply with the emissions requirements of California and can't be registered there. Mary is not obligated to purchase the vehicle.\nExample of a binding bid:\nSteve is bidding on a new rug for his living room and he wins the auction. Later he finds out that the rug isn't big enough to cover his floor and he wants to back out of the sale, claiming the bid was non-binding. Because the rug wasn't listed in a non-binding bid category, Steve is obligated to pay for the rug.\nOther terms\nBuyers shouldn't bid on an item unless they intend to buy it. However, completing the purchase may depend on things like inspections and financing. We strongly encourage sellers to include information in their listings about the requirements a buyer will need to follow (such as deposits, transfer paperwork, and transportation options) after the listing is over.\nWhile eBay can't guarantee the completion of the sale or require members to complete a sale when a listing isn't binding, our rules require sellers and buyers to follow through with the sale in good faith.\nWhy does eBay have this policy?\nIn most cases, a bid on eBay is a legally binding contract between the buyer and the seller. Due to state laws and the complexities of real estate and vehicle transactions, bids in those categories are non-binding."

COAs and LOAs can offer assurance that an autograph is genuine, but you need to be sure the authenticator is reputable.\nWhat information should I include when listing an autograph?\nInclude as much information as you can about the autograph and the item it's been written on. To help your buyer understand exactly what they're buying, we recommend including the following:\nA clear photo of the autographed item\nA clear photo of the COA or LOA, as well as the name of the person or company issuing the certificate\nYour refund policy\nIf you're listing an authorized pre-printed autograph, they should generally be listed in the Autographs > Reprints category. For full details, read our policy below.\nRead our full policy\nAutographed items policy overview\nSince autographed items and trading cards are unique, they can be very valuable, but are also easy to forge or reproduce. Autographs are commonly sold with certificates of authenticity (COAs) and letters of authenticity (LOAs), while trading cards use a grading system. COAs, LOAs, and grades are meant to assure the buyer that the signature or item is genuine. However, COAs, LOAs, and grades are only as valuable as the reputation of the issuing party, so it's important to know the reputation of each authenticator or grader.\nWe investigate concerns from our members in regard to autographs, COAs, LOAs, and trading cards. As part of this policy, we work with several reputable third parties. These third parties may use known authentic autograph examples to determine if these items are genuine or \"likely not genuine.\" If they have concerns about an item’s authenticity, eBay may remove the listing from the site.\nActivity on eBay is required to follow this policy, the eBay User Agreement and all applicable laws, as well as respect the rights of third parties. If it doesn’t, eBay may take action consistent with applicable laws and the eBay User Agreement , and may even be legally required to do so. Such actions may include, as an example only: Removing the listing or other content, issuing a warning, restricting activity or account suspension.\nWhat are the guidelines?\nYou can list autographed items and most trading cards on eBay. These guidelines will help you successfully sell these types of items on our website.\nAutographed items\nBe sure to include the following information in your listing:\nA clear photo of the actual autographed item\nA clear photo of the COA or LOA\nInformation about the COA or LOA, including the name of the person or company issuing the certificate\nRefund policy, in case a reputable dealer informs us or the buyer that the item is \"likely not authentic\"\nAuthentic and authorized pre-printed autographs or autographed items should generally be listed in the Autographs-Reprints category. An authorized pre-printed autograph means a company has acquired the rights to accurately reproduce the original signed item\nDon't list items that contain authentic pre-printed autographs in the Autographs-Original categories. An example of this would be a pre-printed autographed photo of a celebrity that is contained in a press kit\nCertificates of Authenticity (COAs) and Letters of Authenticity (LOAs)\nCOAs and LOAs let buyers know that the signature is \"likely genuine.\" They also benefit sellers by helping to increase the value of their autographed items.\nThere are many reputable autograph experts, and eBay has identified a partial list of authenticators - opens in new window or tab for your benefit.

For more information, please read our full policy below.\nWhat are the benefits of using the Classified Ad format, rather than an auction format, to list my property?\nYou can list your asking price, so there is no bidding. Any interested buyers then fill out a contact form, and their information is sent to you, so you can contact them. You can also choose to advertise your property for 30 or 90 days, and can revise your listing at any time within that period.\nRead our full policy\nReal estate policy overview\nTo best meet the needs of our users while accommodating the wide variety of laws governing the sale of real estate across the globe, eBay offers advertisements of real estate in a variety of formats. These Real Estate Rules explain these format offerings, clarify eBay's limited role as a hosting platform for advertising and venue-provider, and outline certain limitations on eBay's obligations and liabilities. Your use of the eBay Real Estate Pages confirms your agreement to these rules.\neBay Real Estate Inc.\nReal estate advertising services on eBay are offered by eBay Real Estate Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay Inc. On eBay's site and in these Rules, this company is referred to as \"eBay Real Estate.\"\nSelling an undivided interest in a land real estate property is not permitted. An undivided interest is defined as a partial interest by two or more people in the same property. This prohibition shall not apply to mineral rights.\nActivity on eBay is required to follow this policy, the eBay User Agreement and all applicable laws, as well as respect the rights of third parties. If it doesn’t, eBay may take action consistent with applicable laws and the eBay User Agreement , and may even be legally required to do so. Such actions may include, as an example only: Removing the listing or other content, issuing a warning, restricting activity or account suspension.\nSome Examples\nAuction-Style Format Items\nDue to the wide variety of laws governing the sale of real estate, eBay Real Estate auction-style advertisements of real property do not involve legally binding offers to buy and sell. Instead, eBay Real Estate's auctions are simply a way for sellers to advertise their real estate and meet potential buyers. eBay is commonly referred to as an online auction web site, however eBay Real Estate is not a traditional \"auctioneer.\" eBay Real Estate is not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers and, as a result, has no control over the quality, safety or legality of the properties advertised, the truth or accuracy of the postings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items. eBay cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.\nAuction-style format advertisements for the sale of real estate are designed to assist the parties in identifying the most interested potential buyer(s). The listings do not result in binding agreements to buy and sell real estate; however, they do allow sellers and buyers to use eBay Real Estate as a venue to determine who may be most interested in the property. In this format, potential buyers are asked not to bid unless they intend to complete the purchase of the advertised property, subject to customary diligence and contingencies. Sellers are not permitted to claim in their listings that a bid results in a binding obligation to consummate the purchase. Following the close of the auction-style bidding, the sellers and buyers are expected to contact each other to prepare and deliver the appropriate paperwork to buy and sell the property, and to take such other actions as may be required by local laws. As noted below, eBay Real Estate cannot give legal advice to buyers or sellers, and users should seek professional advice when selling or buying real estate. Depending on the property, sellers may be required to deliver to buyers a disclosure statement prior to a sale, and in all cases buyers should conduct their own due diligence related to property inspection, title review, building code compliance, termite inspection, flood plain, hazardous materials and other local issues transparent only to an expert. While eBay Real Estate cannot guarantee consummation of the sale to either seller or potential buyers, our rules require sellers and top-bidding potential buyers to follow through in good faith. If the parties do follow through in good faith, but the transaction does not close, the parties should still leave positive feedback for each other.\nIf you elect to use the \"auction-style\" advertisement for certain kinds of real estate, you will be charged a \"Notice Fee\" when the auction-style advertisement is over. This fee applies whether or not the real estate sale is completed. You will not be charged a \"final value fee\" tied to the sale of the real estate. See Selling Fees for more information.\nClassified Ad Listings\neBay Real Estate also offers sellers the option of advertising their property in a Classified Ad format rather than an auction format. The Real Estate Classified Ad format has the following features:\nYou can list your asking price. No bidding takes place\nInterested buyers fill out a contact form and their information is sent to you\nYou can advertise your property for 30 days or 90 days\nYou may revise your item at any time in the advertisement duration\nReal Estate Classified Ad listings do not result in feedback, because the format aims to generate multiple leads rather than a single high bidder. When this contact information is forwarded to sellers via email, sellers are obliged to treat the potential buyers' contact information in full compliance with our User Privacy Notice. This policy prohibits use of the potential buyers' information for any purpose other than communicating with the potential buyers about the information and services referenced in the item description, unless expressly permitted to do so. Failure to comply with this policy can result in seller expulsion from the eBay community. Once buyers and sellers make contact through these listings, they can, as noted above, then proceed to discuss off the website purchase terms, including price, inspections, and the like, as is customary in an offline real estate transaction.\nPrivate Mortgage Notes\nWithin eBay's \"Other Real Estate\" pages, eBay sellers are permitted to advertise for sale certain purchase money notes and mortgages (referred to in these rules as \"mortgage notes\"). These mortgage notes are created when, in a real estate transaction preceding the offer of the mortgage note on the eBay site, a purchaser of certain real estate obtains financing for all or a portion of a property from the seller, and executes a note in favor of the seller secured by a mortgage on the real property being purchased. A mortgage note created in this manner may be advertised for sale on eBay (in either the Auction format or Classified Ad format) if the following requirements are satisfied:\nThe mortgage note must have arisen in connection with a bona fide real estate transaction\nThe interest offered constitutes the entire indebtedness under the note\nThe purchaser will receive the mortgage note by unconditional endorsement, without recourse, together with a full assignment of the mortgage securing the note, both of which the purchaser will hold until satisfaction of the note\nThe mortgage note is offered without any interposed services or other enhancements to be provided by the seller and\nThe sale of the mortgage note complies with all applicable law\nAll mortgage notes are required to be offered only in the \"Other Real Estate\" category.\nAdditional information\nPrivacy of Information\nSellers must treat buyers' contact information in full compliance with our User Privacy Notice . This policy prohibits sharing the buyer's information with third parties as well as use of the buyer's information for any purpose other than communicating with the buyer about the item, unless expressly permitted to do so by the buyer.\nReal Estate Licensees\nSellers who are licensed as an agent, broker, or other licensed real estate professional must ensure that their item description conforms to all laws and regulations applicable to online advertising of properties by such licensees. These requirements may include, among other things, disclosure of the licensee's name, any firm with which the licensee is affiliated, office location, and the jurisdiction(s) where the licensee is licensed.\nTrading Assistants\nA user may not list real estate for a third-party unless the user is a licensed real estate professional.\nProfessional Assistance\nThe purchase and sale of real estate is a complicated matter that is governed by laws, practices and customs that vary significantly from locality to locality. Sellers are advised that many jurisdictions require that you provide a disclosure statement to all prospective buyers regarding the condition of your property. In addition, under U.S. federal law, sellers have an obligation to disclose information on lead-based paint hazards. Members are strongly advised to seek the help of a licensed real estate professional and/or a real estate attorney to help in the negotiation and sale of any real estate.\nMembers may wish to visit the website of the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials - opens in new window or tab , which offers a search tool providing access to a database of information about the current license or registration status of real estate licensees.\neBay Real Estate's Role as a Venue Provider / Brokerage Relationship (Agency) Disclosure\nThe role of eBay Real Estate in the sale of properties is limited to hosting advertisements provided by sellers and providing a venue for communications about a property. eBay Real Estate is not responsible for, and does not engage in, brokering, selling, purchasing, exchanging, or leasing posted properties or providing a \"multiple listing service\" as that term is traditionally used. eBay Real Estate does not counsel sellers or buyers, show properties, negotiate sales contracts, or hold a position of trust and confidence, whether or not in connection with the eBay website. Accordingly, no brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between eBay Real Estate and any seller or buyer of real estate. eBay Real Estate makes no representations about properties advertised on eBay, about the sellers of such properties, about the accuracy of information provided by such sellers, or about the financial capabilities of prospective buyers. Prospective buyers are advised to perform all due diligence before entering into a contract to purchase property, and, as emphasized above, all parties are encouraged to seek the help of a licensed real estate professional and real estate attorney.\nLicense Information\neBay Real Estate does not purport to broker transactions, although it holds certain state real estate broker licenses .\nRelationship to eBay's User Agreement\nWith respect to real estate items, if these Real Estate Rules conflict with eBay's User Agreement, these rules apply.\nTip Visit Seller Help - opens in new window or tab to find details of any policy issues with your account or listings, and get the information you need to quickly resolve them.\nWhy does eBay have this policy?\neBay and eBay Real Estate want to ensure that sellers and buyers comply with all governmental laws and regulations. Since the sale of real estate is regulated, or may cause harm to eBay, eBay Real Estate or its members, the sale of real estate on eBay is restricted."

        "content": "Help webpage title: Feedback policy \nHelp webpage description:  \nHelp webpage content: Are you looking to leave feedback? Please see our articles:\nLeaving feedback for sellers\nLeaving feedback for buyers\nWhat is the policy?\nOur policy is to ensure that feedback is meaningful for both buyers and sellers. We do not allow feedback that is harmful, inappropriate or irrelevant as this reduces trust between buyers and sellers, and undermines the feedback system. You’ll find more detail below on situations in which we remove feedback. In each case, we make sure we have factual evidence to support removal.\nWhile we’re committed to protecting sellers’ businesses, it’s worth remembering that buyers do not expect to see 100% positive feedback and that eBay is not in a position to contradict buyers’ opinions or judgment of items. We recommend that sellers reply to negative or neutral feedback with a thoughtful, well-written response that demonstrates how much you care about your buyer’s experience.\nHow do we remove feedback?\nWe use automation to proactively remove feedback that goes against our policy but in cases that are not clear-cut, we carry out a manual review. You can request removal through Seller Help , at which point a team member will review it. Depending on the situation, we may remove the comment, ratings and/or images.\nIf your feedback qualifies for removal, you will be notified via email and the feedback will be removed from your account within 24 hours. If it cannot be removed, we will provide clarification as to how it doesn’t violate our policy.\nWhen do we remove feedback?\nHarmful, inappropriate or irrelevant comments and images\nWe remove all feedback that contains any:\nContent promoting hatred, violence or discrimination\nProfane, obscene, adult, illegal, or explicit content\nOpinions on any political, religious, or social issues\nAny implied or explicit threats or intimidation\nPersonally identifiable information\nLinks, URLs, or other content encouraging sales outside of eBay\nInfringement of third-party rights\nMeaningless content or images that aren’t of the item purchased\nComments intended for a different item or seller\nNegative comments with positive ratings, or positive comments with negative ratings\nPersonal attacks that could harm the reputation of the seller or their business and could not reasonably be viewed as constructive criticism\nAny pictures left in feedback should accurately represent the item purchased and follow our policies, including the Images, videos and text policy , the Offensive materials policy , the Restricted adult items policy , and the Illegal explicit content policy .\nSee example\nTim received negative feedback from a buyer about a photo frame that said “Shirt was very poor quality”. Since this feedback was clearly left for the wrong item, it is removable.\nExtortion and manipulation\nWe remove all feedback that:\nIs used as a means to extort another member\nIs used to manipulate feedback ratings (see our Feedback manipulation policy )\nSee example\nJasmine sold a camera, but along with payment she received an email from the buyer stating, “If you don't include an upgraded memory card and a case at no additional charge I'll leave you negative feedback.” This is feedback extortion and as such the feedback is removable.\nBuyer-related transaction issues\nWe remove neutral/negative feedback when we can see that:\nThe buyer asked to cancel after placing their order\nThe order was canceled due to an issue with the buyer’s address\nThe order was canceled because the buyer didn’t pay\nThe buyer is raising an issue that was correctly disclosed in the listing\nThe buyer has been actioned under our Abusive buyer policy\nThe buyer requested a change to an order after they’d paid (and their feedback relates to this)\nSee examples\nSam was asked by a buyer to send an item to an address that was different to the address provided in the order details. Sam didn’t agree, and the buyer left negative feedback saying “I meant to send this to my work address but the seller refused to change it”. This feedback was removed.\nSandra sold a pre-loved dress and received negative feedback that said “There was a small stain on the inside of the dress, wish I’d known, grr!!” However, the item description clearly stated that there was a stain on the inside of the dress. On this basis, the feedback is unjustified and can be removed.\nHowever, if the dress had been described as being in excellent condition, and the information about the stain had not been included in the listing, this feedback would not be removable. In such cases, we recommend replying to the buyer to show that you take their concerns seriously. An example of a good reply would be “I’m sorry to hear you weren’t happy with the dress, I love making my customers happy. Please open a return on eBay and we can arrange for a refund.”\nItem delivery issues\nWe remove neutral/negative feedback when the buyer is referencing:\nA delivery issue where tracking shows us that the delivery or handling time expectations were met\nA delivery issue where a natural disaster or unexpected event caused a carrier delay\nA customs or tax issue outside the seller’s control that we could identify\nSee example\nAkash sold a small car part to an international buyer, and the buyer left negative feedback that said “Import duties way too high”. Since Akash was not the cause of the issue with taxes, the feedback is removable.\nReturns issues\nWe remove neutral/negative feedback when any of the following occurred and this is what the buyer is referencing:\nThe item was returned used or damaged and the seller deducted an amount from the refund\nThe seller declined a change-of-mind return request, as the listing didn’t offer returns\nThe buyer changed their mind and was liable for the cost of an eBay return label\nThe seller offers free returns, handled the return and issued a refund\nSee example\nMaria listed an item and clearly indicated that she doesn’t accept returns. Her buyer gets the item, decides it wasn’t what they wanted and asks to return it. Maria declines because she is not obliged to accept change-of-mind returns and the buyer leaves negative feedback stating “Wouldn’t take the item back after I realized it wasn’t what I wanted”. Since Maria was clear about not accepting returns, the feedback is removable.\neBay site or program issues\nWe remove neutral/negative feedback when:\nThe comment is about not being able to retract a bid\nThe problem was caused by a technical issue on the eBay site that we could identify\nAn eBay Money Back Guarantee case or payment dispute was closed with the seller having met their obligations to the buyer\nThe item was shipped on-time with eBay International Shipping or the Global Shipping Program and there was a shipping-related issue\nThe item was sold under our Authenticity Guarantee program, was shipped on-time and passed authentication\nThe item was sold under our Guaranteed Fit program, the buyer requested a return because the item didn't fit their vehicle, and we can see that the seller met all their obligations to the buyer\nSee example\nLinda sells an item via auction and after the winning bidder receives the item they leave negative feedback stating “I didn’t want this, I tried to cancel my bid and they wouldn’t let me. Guess I’m stuck with it.” Since the buyer’s complaint is about not being able to retract their bid, the feedback is removable.\nTip If you think feedback goes against our policy, you can contact us through Seller Help within 90 days of the transaction to request removal.\nWe regularly review our policy to make sure we’re keeping up with industry standards and being fair to everyone in our community. The enforcement of our Feedback policy, which protects buyers and sellers, is dependent on both parties adhering to all other relevant eBay policies.\nActivity on eBay is required to follow this policy, the eBay User Agreement and all applicable laws, as well as respect the rights of third parties. If it doesn’t, eBay may take action consistent with applicable laws and the eBay User Agreement , and may even be legally required to do so. Such actions may include, as an example only: Removing the listing or other content, issuing a warning, restricting activity or account suspension.\nWhy does eBay have this policy?\nThis policy helps protect the integrity of the eBay feedback system, and builds trust between buyers and sellers."

You should also consider contacting your local phone company if the threat was made by telephone, or the other member's Internet service provider (ISP) if the threat was made through email communication.\nProfanity and hate speech\nMembers aren't allowed to use profanity or hate speech in their communications with other members through eBay.\nFeedback comments containing inappropriate content\nThese types of feedback comments may be removed:\nFeedback containing personally identifying information about another member, such as a member's address, phone number, email address, or real name.

(When the comment is posted by the seller.

We investigate and take action on reports of misuse of this information. Please see our User Privacy Notice for more information on how we handle your personal data.\nWhy does eBay have this policy?\nCommunication between members is a key part of the eBay buying and selling experience, and we want to keep it as open as possible.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Business policies \nHelp webpage description: Whenever you create a listing, you need to choose a set of business policies: the payment, shipping, and return details you specify for buyers. You can make the listing creation process, and the management of any existing listings, more efficient by creating policy templates that store your preferences for each of these areas. \nHelp webpage content: Business policies are important because they let buyers know how they can pay you, how long it will take you to ship an item, the delivery services you offer (including shipping and packaging costs), and whether you accept returns.\nRather than setting your preferences in these areas on a listing-by-listing basis, you can streamline the process by creating templates. These templates can then be applied when creating new listings or even used to update multiple existing listings.\nTip For the best business policies experience, ensure that you opt into Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab .\nIf your business policy preferences vary depending on what you're selling, you can create a range of different templates. This gives you the flexibility to apply different payment, postage, or return details depending on what you're listing. To start using business policies, you need to opt in - opens in new window or tab .\nCreating business policies\nYou can create and manage policies from the business policies - opens in new window or tab dashboard in the Account section of My eBay.\nYou can create your policy templates by following these steps:\nFrom the Create policy dropdown, select a policy type.\nGive the policy a descriptive name and add a brief description.\nAdd your policy details and select Save .\nUpdating business policies\nYou can edit, copy, reassign, or delete your policies whenever you choose. If you update a policy, any listings using that policy will automatically be updated with your changes.\nKeep in mind that there are a few restrictions on revising listings , so it may not be possible to update all your listings with the new policy. In this case, only listings that can be updated with the new information will be changed, and listings that can't be edited will remain unchanged.\nIf you want to delete a policy that is currently being used in any active or scheduled listings, you need to reassign new policies to these listings first.\nPolicies named \"Copy of…\"\nIf you change your shipping, payment or return policy, we'll update all compatible listings associated with that policy to use your new terms.\nAny listings that are incompatible with your updated policy terms or are restricted from being revised will no longer have this updated policy applied to them. An automatically generated policy, beginning with \"Copy of\" will be applied to these incompatible listings. This \"Copy of…\" policy is a duplicate of your policy before your updates were made, so there will be no contractual changes between you and a buyer for these listings.\nTip Give your policies descriptive names such as \"Shipping policy, International\" so you can easily find the one you need.\nBusiness policies in the eBay app\nBusiness policies users can now view and select existing policies from the eBay app when listing an item.\nTo access business policies for your listings in the app:\nTap Selling at the bottom of the app homepage.\nTap List an Item .\nFrom the Listing Summary page: Tap the pen symbol beside Delivery to see your existing shipping policies Tap the pen symbol beside Preferences to see your existing payment or return policies\nTap the pen symbol beside Delivery to see your existing shipping policies\nTap the pen symbol beside Preferences to see your existing payment or return policies\nIf you want to change the selected policy for this listing, tap on the policy you want then tap Done .\nUp to 26 of your most frequently used policies are shown for each type of policy in the selection screen. You can use the search bar to find the policy you need. If the policy you'd like to use is not there, you can add it to the listing using a desktop browser.\nTip Business policies are only available in the app from version 6.2 onwards so if you're using an earlier version of the app, go to the Android Play Store or the iOS App Store to update to the latest version.\nAlthough opt-in to business policies is global, each marketplace requires its own set of business policies. For example, a business policies user on the ebay.com site can only use policies created on ebay.com. If that same seller wishes to list on ebay.de or ebay.ca, they must create policies on that specific site in order to use them, so that the policies reflect the regional shipping options of that marketplace.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes. Select Clean up policies on the Manage business policies page - opens in new window or tab . If you have any policies that aren't being used in active listings, or haven't been used recently, we'll remove them.\nYes, you can override the shipping cost for individual listings without creating a different shipping policy. When you create the listing, next to the dropdown box where you select the shipping policy, select Edit shipping cost for this listing only .\nYou can opt out any time by selecting the Opt out link on the Manage business policies page - opens in new window or tab . Your active listings won't be affected, but if you want to make changes to payment, shipping, and return terms, you'll need to do that individually on each future listing. You can also opt back in to business policies at any time; however your old policies will be deleted when you opt out. You will need to create new policies and associate your listings to them using a bulk editing tool if you opt back in.\nThis usually means there are large numbers of business policies created in the background already associated with your account, and our automated processes were not able to clean them up. Please contact our customer service team for help.\nThese are created when a policy revision has failed. Policy revisions can fail for a few reasons, such as a listing having a pending sale or best offer, or expiring in less than 12 hours. For example, if you revise “PolicyA” and some of the listings fail to revise, a new policy spin-off will be created to preserve the original settings with a name such as “Policy2f364de7aa74000”. In this case, “PolicyA” has the new, revised attributes, and the spin-off policy maintains the original attributes.\nVisit the Manage business policies page - opens in new window or tab to check the update status for progress and error status. When the updates are complete, you will see the update status as \"Updated successfully [Activity log]\". Select the Activity log and download the error report to check for failures.\nAfter the issues are resolved, you can assign these listings to the target policy or choose a different compatible policy.\nIf the error message next to the item id states that the listing is restricted, the only option is to wait for the listing to end or cancel or accept any pending offers associated with that listing. You can then remove these auto-generated policies."

An additional international fee may apply.\nHow to sell internationally\nBefore you can sell internationally, you'll need to:\nHave an eBay account in good standing\nHave earned at least 10 feedback points as a seller\nHave made your first successful sale more than 90 days ago\nPost in an eligible category. Ineligible categories for international sales include Video Games, Movies & TV, Hunting knives, Auto parts, and Vehicles\nOffering shipping to the United Kingdom, Europe, or worldwide. Specifying shipping service to these areas is highly recommended, since listings without specified shipping may be moved to the bottom of Best Match search results\nTip When you sell to overseas buyers, you need to comply with laws in both your country and theirs . Your items must meet the selling and eligibility requirements for the eBay site in each country where you sell.\nHere's how to add international shipping to your listings:\nOn your listing, choose Show international services and options and select Save .\nChoose Flat Rate or Calculated . A flat rate means you choose a shipping cost. Calculated shipping is determined by the buyer's location using US Postal Service pricing.\nSelect the countries you'll ship to from Destination , and choose your preferred shipping carrier from Service .\nTip We may ask you to sign an International Selling Agreement acknowledging that items sold to buyers on other eBay sites are subject to the policies of those sites. Be sure to familiarize yourself with listing and buyer protection policies on the eBay sites where you sell.\nChoosing where to ship to\nYou can choose the countries you want to ship to in different ways:\nOn an item-by-item basis: Whenever you list an item, select international shipping locations on the listing form.

These rules will apply to any future listings you create\nReceiving payments from international buyers\nIf the buyer pays in a different currency, the payment will be converted to the currency of your payouts.

This exchange rate will apply in the event of a refund.\nWhen you ship internationally, an additional international fee applies.\neBay's transaction fees will be deducted in the buyer’s payment currency, before being converted to your payout currency. If you receive a fee credit, it will be converted from your buyer’s payment currency to your payout currency. See our fees article for more information on the currency conversion charge .\nInternational site visibility and fees\nInternational site visibility is an optional upgrade that ensures your eBay.com listings are visible in top-level search results on other eBay sites.

These fees aren't refundable unless your listing doesn't meet the other country's requirements.\nFor more information on fees, see our article on selling fees .\nReaching Canadian buyers\nListings created on eBay.com that offer shipping to Canada, North America, or worldwide automatically show up in the default search results on eBay.ca at no extra charge.

By using a reserve price, you can set a low starting price for your auction—and boost interest in your item—without the risk of selling your item for less than you think it’s worth. \nHelp webpage content: Are you a buyer looking for information on reserve prices? Read our article on how reserve prices work\nReserve price is an optional upgrade for auction-style listings , with a fee that is charged at the time of listing.\nWhen you set a reserve price, bidders will see that you have a reserve price in place and whether it has been met, but not the reserve price itself.\nIf the highest bid at the end of the auction is below your reserve price, you don’t have to sell the item, however the reserve price fee won’t be refunded.\nWhen to add a reserve price\nWhen listing a high price item, consider adding a reserve price if you’re not sure of its true value, but don’t want to sell below a certain price. The reserve price will protect you from selling your item for less than you're happy with.\nHowever, if you're selling an item with a low average selling price, the reserve price upgrade fee, combined with the final value fee, might be too high to justify adding a reserve price.\nInstead, set your auction starting price to the minimum amount you’re happy to sell the item for, with no reserve. If your item sells, your fees will be lower than if you’d added a reserve price, and if it doesn’t sell, you won't be out-of-pocket for the reserve price fee.\nRemember, final value fees may vary depending on the item price and listing category.\nHow to add a reserve price to a new listing\nWhen you’re creating an auction-style listing, you’ll see the option to add your reserve price in the Pricing section.\nHow to add a reserve price to an existing listing\nIf an existing listing hasn’t received any bids and there are at least 12 hours left in the listing, you can add a reserve price.\nTo add a reserve price to an existing auction listing:\nFind your listing in My eBay Selling - opens in new window or tab or Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab .\nSelect Revise from More actions.\nIn the Pricing section, enter your reserve price.\nSelect Continue.\nHow to change a reserve price\nIf your reserve price isn’t met, then your listing will end without a sale. To help make sure that doesn’t happen, you can lower the reserve price.\nYou can lower the reserve price when:\nNo bidder has met the reserve price, and\nAt least 12 hours are left on the listing\nYou can remove the reserve price when:\nThere are no bids on your listing, and\nAt least 12 hours left on your listing\nTo lower or remove the reserve price:\nFind your listing in My eBay Selling - opens in new window or tab or Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab .\nSelect Revise from More actions.\nIn the Pricing section, lower or remove your reserve price.\nSelect Continue.\nIf you lower the reserve price below the high bidder’s maximum bid, we’ll lower the high bidder’s maximum bid to $1.00 below the new reserve price. After you lower a reserve price, we’ll contact bidders to let them know about the change and ask them to bid again to reconfirm their interest. You can’t remove the reserve price if there are bids on your listing.\nWhen you lower or remove a reserve price, you won’t receive a credit for the reserve fee.\nWithin eBay Motors vehicle categories, you can lower reserve prices on listings with less than 12 hours left in the auction."

        "content": "Help webpage title: Shill bidding policy \nHelp webpage description:  \nHelp webpage content: When someone bidding on an item knows the seller, they might have information about the seller's item that other shoppers aren't aware of. This could create an unfair advantage or cause another bidder to pay more than they should. We want to maintain a fair marketplace for all our users, and as such, shill bidding is prohibited on eBay. For more details on what constitutes shill bidding, please see our full policy guidelines below.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I use Buy It Now to buy items from people I know?\nYes, you can use Buy It Now to purchase an item from a seller you know.\nCan my employees bid on my listings?\nNo, your employees can’t bid on your items, and you’re not allowed to bid on theirs. Sellers with employees should make sure their workers are also aware of this policy.\nHow do I report shill bidding?\nIf you think that another member is shill bidding, you don't need to report it to us. eBay has a number of systems in place to detect and monitor bidding patterns and practices. If we identify any malicious behavior, we'll take steps to prevent it.\nRead our full policy\nPolicy overview\nShill bidding happens when anyone—including family, friends, roommates, employees, or online connections—bids on an item with the intent to artificially increase its price or desirability. In addition, members cannot bid on or buy items in order to artificially increase a seller's feedback or to improve the item's search standing .\nShill bidding is also illegal in many places and can carry severe penalties.\nWhat are the guidelines?\nBuying an item from someone you know, as long as you don't intend to artificially increase its price or desirability or violate our feedback manipulation or search and browse manipulation policies.\nBidding on your own items with another account\nActivity on eBay is required to follow this policy, the eBay User Agreement and all applicable laws, as well as respect the rights of third parties.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Selling practices policy \nHelp webpage description:  \nHelp webpage content: Our full selling practice guidelines below provide a range of tips for helping ensure you keep your buyers happy. They cover areas such as the item description, your terms and conditions, shipping and handling charges, delivery times, communication, returns, and photos.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy do I need to specify the location of the item in my listing?\nBuyers like to know where the item is being shipped from as it helps to give them an idea of how much shipping will cost and how long it might take for the item to arrive. Having an inaccurate item location can cause confusion and lead to a poor experience for your buyer.\nWhat should I include in my terms and conditions?\nBe very clear and thorough about the terms of the transaction and include information about any taxes or other applicable fees, shipping and handling, and your return policy. Being upfront and honest about these terms helps build trust and provides a positive buying experience for your customers.\nDo I have to accept returns?\nYou don't have to accept returns, but we highly recommend you do – it might help you attract more buyers. If you do accept returns, make sure you specify the time period in which you accept returns, who pays for the return postage, and how the refund is issued.\nRead our full policy\nSelling practices policy overview\nSetting clear buyer expectations and then meeting or exceeding them is a great way to make your buyer happy and ensure a smooth transaction.\nSome of the simplest things you can do are to provide accurate and consistent details about your items and to be clear and specific about the terms and conditions of the sale. You should also make every effort to provide excellent customer service from start to finish, including:\nCharging reasonable shipping and handling costs\nSpecifying your handling time and return policy in your listing\nResponding to buyers' questions promptly\nBeing professional throughout the transaction\nMaking sure the item is delivered to the buyer as described in your listing\nFrequently reviewing and updating listings to make sure all information – such as inventory status and item condition – is accurate and up to date\nTo help you meet our seller performance , we have some basic requirements all sellers must meet. We also have tips on how you can meet – and exceed – buyers' expectations.\nWhat are the guidelines?\nShipping service\nBuyers expect their items to be delivered on time, especially when they pay additional fees for expedited shipping services. Using a slower shipping service than the one selected by the buyer during checkout may result in the item being delivered later than expected, and an increase in claims for items not received.\nWhat to do\nOffer shipping service options in your listings only after reviewing their costs and delivery speeds\nShip items using shipping service options with features that meet or exceed those the buyer selected\nWhat not to do\nUse shipping service options with features that do not meet those selected by the buyer. For example, using \"USPS Ground\" with a maximum delivery estimate of 7 days when the buyer selected \"USPS Priority Mail\" with a delivery estimate of 3 days.\nShipping and handling costs\nBe sure to specify shipping costs and related service charges in your listings.\nWhat to charge\nActual shipping cost: This is the amount for shipping the item. It should be what you paid the carrier.\nHandling cost: This can include the cost of packaging materials and insurance cost, if any.\nDelivery confirmation and extra services: If you choose to use these options, you must add them to your shipping and handling costs, and you can only charge what they actually cost. Examples of services include: Certificate of Mailing Certified Mail Collect on Delivery Delivery Confirmation - free with Priority Mail and discounted with some other services when you print shipping labels on eBay Registered Mail Restricted Delivery Return Receipt Signature Confirmation Special Handling\nCertificate of Mailing\nCertified Mail\nCollect on Delivery\nDelivery Confirmation - free with Priority Mail and discounted with some other services when you print shipping labels on eBay\nRegistered Mail\nRestricted Delivery\nReturn Receipt\nSignature Confirmation\nSpecial Handling\nTax and government-imposed fees: Only applicable federal, state, country, city, Value Added Tax (VAT), or equivalent taxes may be charged.\nTips:\nIf your shipping and handling costs are higher than average, consider explaining in your listing what the shipping and handling costs include.\nWe recommend that you provide tracking information. Using tracking information, delivery confirmation, or signature confirmation can help protect you if a buyer reports that they didn't receive an item. This is one of the qualifications for getting an automatic 5-star rating for shipping time.\nCategories with maximum shipping costs\nWe set maximum shipping costs in some categories. You can only charge more than the maximum shipping cost if you use calculated shipping and enter an item's actual size and weight with the packing materials.\nWhen using calculated shipping, make sure the calculated cost isn't higher than the actual shipping cost. If so, it's considered excessive shipping, which isn't allowed on eBay.\nFree shipping\nYou can offer free shipping to select or all destinations.\nFor a destination with free shipping, no other fees related to shipping, handling, or packaging can be charged.\nYou're not allowed to use a shipping method that is slower than the slowest one indicated in the listing.\nIf you offer free shipping in your listing – and we can confirm the buyer didn't pay for shipping – you will automatically receive a 5-star rating on your shipping and handling charges detailed seller rating.\nShipping and handling time\nBuyers want to know when they can expect to get their items.\nWhat to do\nSpecify in your listing clearly and accurately when the item will be shipped.\nShip items within the handling time you state in your listing.\nUse tracking, delivery confirmation, or signature confirmation. Using delivery confirmation can help protect you if a buyer claims an item wasn't received . Note: If the total order cost (total of item(s), shipping and tax) is $750 or more signature confirmation is required. Having signature confirmation protects you if a buyer reports that they didn't receive an item. Learn more about signature confirmation requirements .\nYou're required to select the shipping option that best matches the shipping service that you offer in the listing. This helps set buyer expectations about when the item will be delivered.\nWhat not to do\nIf your funds are not immediately available from payments for an item you sold, you're not allowed to hold shipment until the funds are released.\nListing formats without handling time\nClassified Ads\nReal Estate Ad format\nCategories that don't require handling time\nAll Motor Vehicle categories\nReal Estate\nSpecialty Services\nSpecial consideration for specific categories\nIn certain categories we may require tracking information, specific handling times, or both. This is to enhance the buying experience and to meet industry standards for some items.\nYou'll automatically receive a 5-star shipping time detailed seller rating if:\nYou specify either same business day or 1 business day handling.\nYou upload US Postal Service, UPS, or FedEx supported tracking information by the end of the next business day (Pacific Time) after the buyer's payment clears. For same business day handling, upload tracking within 1 business day. A business day is a normal weekday. Saturdays, Sundays, and major holidays aren't business days.\nTracking data must show the package as having a status of \"delivered\" with a delivery date within 4 days of payment clear.\nNote: In some instances, there may be a delay in processing your shipping details, and buyers may be able to leave you a detailed seller rating for shipping time. If you've met the automatic 5-star shipping time requirements, your rating will be adjusted to 5 stars.\nTerms and conditions\nIt's important that you clearly specify the terms and conditions of the sale in your listing so that buyers know what to expect.\nWhat to do\nYou're required to include the following details in your listing:\nReturn policy\nShipping method, costs, and other information\nTerms of the transaction\nYou're required to meet the expectations you've set in your listing:\nEnsure the safe delivery of the item within the timeframe stated in your listing\nComply with the Presale listings policy where applicable\nItems you list must be in your inventory or you must have an existing agreement with a third party to fulfill the delivery of the item under the terms of your listing\nTracking\nProviding tracking details for items you've sold is an industry standard and something that your buyers expect. Tracking data lets buyers know where their item is throughout the shipping process, and can be critical in cases where the buyer claims they didn't receive an item. Learn more about uploading tracking information .\nWhat to do\nUpload accurate tracking details\nUpload tracking details within your specified handling time\nMark the item as 'Shipped' in My eBay or Seller Hub once it has been sent\nWhat not to do\nUpload information other than valid tracking in the tracking field, including tracking not associated with the transaction\nUpload tracking information later than the handling time window promised in your listing\nItem location misrepresentation\nWhen a buyer purchases an item, they expect it to be shipped from the item location included in the listing. Including false, inaccurate, vague, or misleading item location information may lead to confusion around delivery time and shipping costs.\nWhat to do\nInclude accurate item location descriptions. The city and state, or city and country should match appropriately. For example: Hong Kong, China Sydney, Australia Omaha, Nebraska, United States\nHong Kong, China\nSydney, Australia\nOmaha, Nebraska, United States\nWhat not to do\nProvide incorrect or inaccurate item location\nState 'U.S.' when the item is actually being shipped from China\nInclude inaccurate, vague, or misleading item location descriptions, such as: Beijing, United Kingdom Hong Kong, United Kingdom Worldwide, Singapore Direct from manufacturer to, United States Somewhere in Florida, United States\nBeijing, United Kingdom\nHong Kong, United Kingdom\nWorldwide, Singapore\nDirect from manufacturer to, United States\nSomewhere in Florida, United States\nInclude item location information in the item description that doesn't match the information in the item location field\nInclude inconsistent information in your return policy around the item location which may result in higher return costs or confusion for buyers\nItem description\nThe listing page is where buyers get most of their information about an item. Information in the listing helps buyers decide what to buy and know what to expect when they receive the item. It's important to make sure that the listing is only used to describe the item for sale and to communicate the terms of the sale in a professional way.\nYou're required to:\nSpecify the condition of the item\nDescribe any defects or flaws in the item – this helps avoid problems or buyer dissatisfaction\nNote: When selling a used, refurbished, or flawed item, you must include photos of the actual item for sale instead of a stock photo.\nCancel orders\nYou may need to cancel an order because the item is broken or out of stock, you made a mistake in your listing, the buyer requested to cancel the order, there's a problem with the buyer's shipping address, or the buyer hasn't paid. Make sure you use the correct process in My eBay or Seller Hub to cancel the order. Learn more about How sellers can cancel an order .\nWhat to do\nCancel the order within 30 days of the sale\nUse the correct process in My eBay or Seller Hub to cancel the order: In My eBay go to Sold , or in Seller Hub go to Orders Find the order you want to cancel, and from More actions , select Cancel this order\nIn My eBay go to Sold , or in Seller Hub go to Orders\nFind the order you want to cancel, and from More actions , select Cancel this order\nChoose a reason for the cancellation and follow the on-screen instructions. The \"Buyer Hasn't Paid\" reason code will be displayed if the buyer hasn't paid for the item within 4 calendar days\nWhat not to do\nDon't cancel the order more than 30 days after the sale\nDon't use an incorrect process outside of My eBay or Seller Hub to cancel the order\nDon't select the wrong cancellation reason in order to avoid a defect on your account, receive a final value fee credit, or remove or block buyer feedback\nLearn more about our Order cancellation policy .\nCommunication\nDo whatever you can to provide excellent customer service. Meeting or exceeding buyers' expectations can help you improve your performance on eBay.\nWhat to do\nRespond promptly to any questions during the bidding or buying process, as well as after the item has been purchased\nCommunicate professionally, including emails\nBe responsive to any buyer concerns or problems\nWhat not to do\nYou're not allowed to use profane or offensive language with anyone on eBay\nYou're not allowed to send anyone on eBay inappropriate images including nudity, profanity or other general content not related to an eBay listing\nMost often, transactions without additional communication are a sign of great service, and you shouldn't receive low detailed seller ratings for communication in these situations.\nTo give you credit for transactions where a buyer doesn't need to contact you, you'll automatically receive a 5-star communication detailed seller rating if:\nYou specify either same business day or one business day handling and upload tracking information within one business day\nThere are no buyer- or seller-initiated communications in eBay Messages\nThere are no requests for contact information between you and the buyer\nThere are no refund requests or any open disputes for the transaction, and the buyer hasn't reported that the item wasn't received.\nNote: Best Offers, Second Chance Offers, invoices and invoice requests – even if they contain messages added by the buyer or seller – don't affect automatic 5-star detailed seller ratings for communication. You'll still qualify for an automatic 5-star communication detailed seller rating if you or your buyers send these types of communications.\nIf eBay shortens the delivery estimate shown to your buyer, we automatically remove any defects related to shipping speed when you upload tracking within your stated handling time and your item arrives on or before the last day of the standard delivery timeframe (your stated handling time plus the carrier's published timeframe).\nCommunication between a buyer and seller isn't undesirable. If you exchange messages – and the buyer is satisfied with your response – the buyer may give you five stars for communication based on their interaction with you.\nReturns\nYou aren't required to accept returns, but if you do, you must honor your stated returns policy.\nWhen you choose to accept returns, a buyer can return an item for any reason, including if they change their mind about a purchase. As long as the return meets your stated return requirements, you are required to honor the return.\nWhat to do\nIf you don't want to accept returns, make sure that both the International and Domestic returns check boxes are unselected\nIf you accept returns, you must clearly state the criteria under which you will accept a return. This may include (but isn't limited to): The time period in which a buyer must notify you about a return Who pays for return shipping How the refund is issued (money back, replacement, or exchange)\nThe time period in which a buyer must notify you about a return\nWho pays for return shipping\nHow the refund is issued (money back, replacement, or exchange)\nRemember, buyers who purchase from you are entering in to a contract with you based on the details you included in your listing, including what you stated in your returns policy. Therefore, you may not add to or alter your returns criteria once an item has been purchased.\nEven if you specify that you don't accept returns, a buyer may be able to open an eBay Money Back Guarantee case for eligible items if they didn't receive an item or the item doesn't match the listing description. Learn more about Seller performance .\nPhotos\nAlong with the description, photos are the most important part of a listing. Photos help buyers to see exactly what they're getting as well as specific details they may be looking for. When selling used items, photos are especially important because they let the buyer see the actual condition of the item along with other details like color.\nPricing promotions terms and conditions\nWhen you place an item on sale and indicate an original price, you are required to follow rules concerning the original price and tools that you use to create a sale or promotion. Learn more about the pricing and promotions terms and conditions - opens in new window or tab .\nIndependent pricing\nTo maintain a competitive marketplace, eBay requires that you price your items independently from other sellers. You may take into account the pricing of other sellers that you observe on the eBay site, but you may not contact another seller to coordinate pricing in any way.\nOther rules for sellers\nYou're responsible for reviewing and understanding our rules for sellers , as well as all relevant laws and regulations in your User Agreement . Knowing our policies before you list an item can lead to smoother, more successful transactions, and it can help you avoid breaking rules by mistake.\nActivity on eBay is required to follow this policy, the eBay User Agreement and all applicable laws, as well as respect the rights of third parties. If it doesn’t, eBay may take action consistent with applicable laws and the eBay User Agreement , and may even be legally required to do so.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Seller standards policy \nHelp webpage description: Our seller performance requirements are intended to help ensure that buyers have a great experience on eBay. Your seller level indicates whether you're meeting or exceeding our minimum standards. \nHelp webpage content: This page describes our seller standards program. Another way in which we evaluate seller performance is by using service metrics .\nEvery month we take a look at how much you've sold recently, and how many of those sales resulted in a poor experience for the buyer, such as not receiving the item they ordered. We measure individual performance on areas within your control – fulfilling orders on time and resolving any buyer issues promptly. We also have some safeguards in place to protect sellers and ensure fair evaluation.\nIt's important to check your Seller Dashboard on a regular basis so you can see how your performance is tracking, and, if needed, take action before the next evaluation. Use the button below to see your current seller level, as well as what it would be if we evaluated you today.\nIf your current or projected seller level has dropped to Below Standard, it's important to focus on minimizing cases closed without seller resolution and order cancellations as soon as possible – this will help to improve your performance on these metrics at the next evaluation. For more help, read our article on Monitoring and improving your seller performance .\nWhat is the policy?\nAll sellers are required to maintain the following minimum performance standards for their listings on eBay.com within their evaluation period:\nCases closed without seller resolution : No more than 2 (or 0.3% of transactions)\nTransaction defect rate : No more than 2% of transactions\nWe evaluate your performance on the 20th of each month based on your recent sales, and assign you one of the following seller levels:\nTop Rated means you're exceeding our performance expectations, as well as having an established sales history and complying with other eBay policies\nAbove Standard means you're meeting our expectations\nBelow Standard means that your performance has fallen below our minimum standards and as a result, we may place limitations on your selling activity , including charging higher final value fees, until your performance improves\nIf you are Top Rated, this will be shown in your feedback profile. Otherwise, other eBay members can't see your seller level.\nDifferent performance thresholds may apply on other eBay sites or if you're selling to international buyers. To understand how your performance is evaluated when selling internationally, please read our Global seller performance policy .\nHow we calculate your seller level\nOn the 20th of each month, we take a look at your recent transactions to work out your:\nCases closed without seller resolution\nTransaction defect rate\nLate shipment rate\nTo make sure we're getting a fair picture, we'll adjust how far we look back (the \"evaluation period\") depending on how much you've sold recently:\nIf you had more than 400 transactions in the past 3 months, we'll count all those transactions\nIf you had fewer than 400 transactions in the past 3 months, we'll count all your transactions from the last 12 months\nTo help understand how evaluations work, please see our calculation examples below.\nCases closed without seller resolution\nWhat this means\nWhen a buyer reports that an item hasn't arrived or requests a return, the seller is responsible for providing a resolution.\nA case closed without seller resolution means that the seller didn't resolve the buyer's issue, eBay stepped in to review the case, and the seller was found responsible.\nFor full details of actions, time frames, requirements for sellers and how eBay decides the outcome of a case, please read our eBay Money Back Guarantee policy .\nMinimum requirements\nYou're allowed 2 cases closed without seller resolution within an evaluation period, or 0.3% of your transactions – whichever is higher.\nTransaction defect rate\nWhat this means\nWe count a transaction defect when either of these things happen:\nThe seller cancels the order unexpectedly (e.g. because it was out of stock, or because they sold it to someone else)\nThe buyer reports an issue, but the seller doesn't resolve it (a case closed without seller resolution , as defined in the section above)\nMinimum requirements\nYou're allowed up to 2% of transactions with defects within an evaluation period.\nYou'll only be evaluated as Below Standard if your transaction defects are associated with more than 4 different buyers.\nLate shipment rate\nWhat this means\nWe help set buyers' expectations by showing them an estimated delivery date for their order. To help ensure items arrive on time, sellers are responsible for shipping items within their stated handling time, using the delivery service selected by the buyer.\nHow we count a late shipment depends on whether you've uploaded tracking information from an integrated carrier .\nWith tracking, we'll count an item as late when:\nThe delivery scan is after the latest estimated delivery date AND\nThere is no carrier scan within your handling time.\nIf there is no tracking information available:\nWhen the buyer leaves feedback, we'll ask them if the item arrived on time.\nIf the buyer confirms the item arrived after the estimated delivery date, it will be counted as late.\nMinimum requirements\nA high late shipment rate on its own won't cause your account to be evaluated as Below Standard, but a low rate is required for Top Rated status .\nCalculation examples\nSales volume vs. transaction defects These examples illustrate how we compare your rates of transactions with defects against our minimum requirements to determine your seller level.\nJon – occasional seller\nJon is an occasional seller, so we look back at all of his transactions over the last 12 months. He's had 3 cases closed without seller resolution, which is relatively high compared to how many times he's sold an item. Unfortunately, it means he's not meeting our minimum seller standards.\nEvaluation period\n12 months (100 transactions)\nCases closed without seller resolution\n3 of 100 transactions (3%)\nThis is more than 2 cases, and more than 0.3% of transactions.\nTransaction defect rate\n0 transactions canceled for being out of stock\n3 cases closed without seller resolution\n3% (3 of 100 transactions)\nThis is more than 2% of transactions.\nLate shipment rate\n5% (5 of 100 transactions)\nThere are no minimum requirements for late shipment rate.\nSeller level\nBelow Standard\nTrudy – small business seller\nTrudy runs a small business on eBay, so we only need to look back at the last 3 months to get a fair picture of performance. She's also had 3 cases closed without seller resolution and a few problems with stock which meant she had to cancel some orders. Despite these issues, when taken as a proportion of the total number of transactions, Trudy is meeting our minimum seller standards.\nEvaluation period\n3 months (1,000 transactions)\nCases closed without seller resolution\n3 of 1,000 transactions (0.3%)\nThis is more than 2 cases, but it isn't more than 0.3% of transactions.\nTransaction defect rate\n4 transactions canceled for being out of stock\n3 cases closed without seller resolution\n0.7% (7 of 1,000 transactions)\nThis is less than 2% of transactions.\nLate shipment rate\n1.0% (10 of 1,000 transactions)\nThere are no minimum requirements for late shipment rate.\nSeller level\nAbove Standard\nTransaction defects vs. unique buyers These examples illustrate how we also consider the number of unique buyers when calculating your seller level. This ensures you're protected from having your evaluation skewed by just one or two buyers.\nFabric Revolutions – small business\nFabric Revolutions is a popular handcraft store on eBay with a lot of loyal customers. One day the manager found a damaged bolt of fabric but didn't get a chance to update their listing until the following day. In the meantime, two buyers had bought from the listing. One was the coordinator of a virtual sewing club, so they had placed multiple orders to be sent separately to each of their participants.\nEvaluation period\n3 months (1,000 transactions)\nCases closed without seller resolution\n0\nThis is less than 2, and less than 0.3% of transactions.\nTransaction defect rate\n25 transactions canceled for being out of stock\n0 cases closed without seller resolution\n2.5% (25 of 1,000 transactions)\nUnique buyers: 2\nAlthough this is more than 2% of transactions, it doesn't affect the seller rating because there are fewer than 4 buyers involved.\nLate shipment rate\n0.8% (8 of 1,000 transactions)\nThere are no minimum requirements for late shipment rate.\nSeller level\nAbove Standard\nSam – small business\nSam sells bike parts on eBay.

Congratulations on winning the statue! Please send me a cashier's check, payable to Jack Johnson\". Joe is suspicious, because the email address of the sender doesn't match Bob's eBay-registered email address. So, Joe contacts Bob at Bob's official address. Bob tells Joe that Jack Johnson must be impersonating him, and that Joe should not send Mr. Johnson any money. Instead, Bob and Joe work out the correct payment details, using their officially registered email addresses.\nAdditional information\nPersonal information - such as names, addresses, passwords, credit card numbers - are sensitive and valuable. Personal information can also be valuable to individuals trying to defraud eBay members. To try to get this type of information from an eBay member, one of these individuals might send a member an email claiming to be eBay or another eBay member and requesting personal information.

Make sure to let international buyers know this in your listings.\nMexico withholding\nIn order to comply with recent changes to tax laws in Mexico, sellers who reside in Mexico should verify that the personal information on file with eBay, such as name, address and date of birth, matches that information on file with the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT).

For example, if the buyer receives a 20% refund of the total amount of the sale, then you'll be credited 20% of the eligible fees that you were charged. See the detailed examples below.\nExample 1\nA buyer purchases a blouse for $50, plus $12 for expedited shipping. The seller is able to use a less expensive option and refunds the buyer $5 of the original shipping cost.\nOrder details\nItem price\nShipping\nTax (9.75%)\n$50.00\n$12.00\n$6.05\nTotal amount of the sale:\n$68.05\nSeller fees\nFinal value fee variable percentage (13.25% of $68.05)\nPer order fixed amount (not eligible for credit)\n$9.02\n$0.40\nSeller fees on original order:\n$9.42\nBuyer refund details\nSeller refund to buyer\neBay refund of tax (9.75% of $5.00)\n$5.00\n$0.49\nTotal refund amount to buyer:\n$5.49\nSeller fee credit details\nThe buyer's refund ($5.49) is 8.1% of their original order ($68.05), so the seller receives credits for 8.1% of each of the eligible fees that they were charged\nFinal value fee credit ( 8.1% of $9.02)\n$0.73\nTotal fee credits to seller:\n$0.73\nExample 2\nA buyer purchased a designer sweatshirt in size small for $75, but the seller mistakenly sent a size medium.

If the full fee was originally charged to a credit or debit card, then the fee may be refunded back to the same method used to pay the fee.\nYou can see fee credit details on your financial statement .\nInsertion fee credits\nIn some circumstances you may be eligible for an insertion fee credit for your relisted items and for auction-style items that sell.\nInsertion fee credits for relisted items\nIf you relist your item because it didn't sell the first time around or a transaction has fallen through, you may qualify for an insertion fee credit.

For example, you might assert who pays for return shipping or that you’re willing to accept returns for a specific period of time after a sale. Whatever you decide your policy is, it needs to be clearly specified in your listings.\nIf your policy is to accept returns, you can set up rules that automate the way that you manage different parts of the return process. For example, you can create rules to:\nAccept some returns automatically, while continuing to process others manually\nRefund the buyer automatically and allow them to keep the item if the return shipping cost is higher than the item’s cost\nProvide different return addresses for different items\nHandling some returns automatically not only saves you time, it’s also great customer service: the buyer gets their return request sorted right away.\nYour returns rules options\nYou can choose to offer one of the following return policies:\nNo returns\n30-day buyer-paid returns\n30-day free returns\n60-day buyer-paid returns\n60-day free returns\nSome product categories have unique retail standards where you’ll be able to offer variations on the returns policy options.\nYou can offer 14-day returns in the following categories:\nCamera Drones\nCamera Lenses\nCollectibles & Art\nDigital Cameras\nJewelry\nMedical & Mobility\nSetting your returns rules\nHere’s how to set your returns rules:\nGo to your Returns preferences - opens in new window or tab .\nUnder Send a refund, you can choose to let buyers keep the item and automatically refund them if the refund amount is less than a certain amount.

Enter an amount you’re comfortable with.\nChoose the return reasons when this rule will apply.\nChanges to your return rules will automatically apply to all future return requests but won’t apply to returns already in progress.\nCreating advanced returns rules\nYou can also create your own advanced return rules - opens in new window or tab .

Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide as set forth under Section 18.C below. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA's International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent mutual written agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org - opens in new window or tab and www.icdr.org - opens in new window or tab . In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link - opens in new window or tab . The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account. If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration or small claims proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend remotely, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.

Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide as set forth under Section 18.C below. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA's International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent mutual written agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org - opens in new window or tab and www.icdr.org - opens in new window or tab . In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link - opens in new window or tab . The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account. If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration or small claims proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend remotely, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.

Buyers who see this message may be less likely to buy your item.\nCommon HTTP content includes externally hosted pictures, cascading style sheets (CSS), HTML5 video and audio, and trading and inventory APIs.\nTip If you don’t see a “view full item description” button when viewing your listings, it means they don’t contain non-secure content and will continue to display as normal.\nUpdating your listings to HTTPS\nIf any of your listings contain non-secure content, you should update them to HTTPS.\nHere’s what to do:\nUse our tool - opens in new window or tab to identify your eBay listings that contain non-secure HTTP content.\nFor any listings that are flagged, make sure all your resources from third-party domains (e.g. photobucket.com) are HTTPS compliant. You may need to contact some of the sites you use.\nOnce you’ve confirmed that your domains support HTTPS, find all uses of “HTTP” in your listings and replace them with “HTTPS.”\nIf you’re using a host domain that doesn’t support HTTPS, you can remove that content from your listings to make them compliant.\nTip If you use a third-party selling solution, contact your provider for assistance identifying and updating non-secure content and making your listings HTTPS compliant.\nEditing listings in bulk\nYou can edit up to 200 listings at once in Seller Hub. Here’s how:\nGo to the Listings tab in Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab to see all the non-compliant listings (that are not yet secured with HTTPS).\nChoose up to 200 listings at once and select Edit .\nFrom the dropdown menu under Edit Fields, select Item Description .\nFrom the action dropdown menu, select Edit listings in bulk - find and replace .\nIn the Find field, enter “HTTP.” In the Replace with field, enter “HTTPS.”\nSelect Save and Close ."

The program covers only defects and damages that prevent the equipment from functioning, not defects or damages that are cosmetic or not critical to operating the equipment\nWhat’s not covered?\nThe following situations are not covered by BEPP:\nAny damage on an item that’s 20 years old or older. If the model year is not specified in the eBay listing, then the item isn’t eligible for any undisclosed damage\nRegular maintenance\nNormal wear and tear, including but not limited to rust, dents, scratches, or cosmetic damage that doesn’t impair the item\nSending a non-refundable deposit and not receiving the item or a refund, because you chose not to complete the transaction or not to pay the remaining balance\nAny damage or defect that was explained to or noticed by you prior to purchase or (if the buyer picked up the item from the seller in person) that you could have noticed upon reasonable inspection\nItems not listed on eBay Business in one of the capital equipment categories\nItems purchased for less than $1,000\nItems damaged or lost in shipping\nInspection costs, warranty fees, and other related expenses\nIf you changed your mind about a purchase\nAny repairs or alterations made to the item after the listing end date that were not authorized by the third-party provider of eBay’s Business Equipment Purchase Protection program\nFiling a claim\nIf something goes wrong, you should contact the seller before filing a claim. Most sellers are happy to rectify any issues that come up.\nHowever, if you’re not satisfied with any resolution offered by the seller, you can file a claim up to 45 days from the day the listing ended.\nIf your claim relates to stolen items or undisclosed liens, you can file a claim up to 6 months from the day the listing ended.\nTo file a claim, select the Submit BEPP reimbursement request button below and fill out the form. Our third-party partner will investigate and process your claim, which generally takes 30–45 days.\nWe’ll also send a copy of your claim to the seller via email so they’ll have the opportunity to respond. Sometimes this makes them aware or reminds them of the problem, and they’re happy to resolve it.\nWhile your claim is being processed, it’s important to provide all payment documentation (full or deposit).

You’ll be required to provide repair estimates from at least 2 properly licensed repair facilities, OEM service divisions, or other industry experts as approved by the third-party provider. You must obtain and submit to the third-party provider an estimate for the repair of any damage included in your claim within 14 days from the date the claim was filed.

This also means that you’re not allowed to bid with another user ID and doing so could result in suspension from eBay.\nYou can contact the seller to ask them if they'll remove your block.\nVehicle history reports\nMany sellers include a vehicle history report from AutoCheck.

Learn more about the fees for selling vehicles .\nChanging the price on a vehicle listing\nYou can change your item’s price on vehicle listings with a reserve price in some categories. However, you can only change it in the following Motors categories: Cars & Trucks, Motorcycles, Other Vehicles & Trailers, and Powersports.\nWhy revise your price?\nRevising your price may increase your chances of selling your item. You can lower your reserve or Buy It Now price, add a Buy It Now price, or remove the reserve price.\nRevising your price: requirements table\nChange\nWhat’s allowed\nWhat happens\nLowering your reserve or Buy It Now price\nYou can lower the reserve or Buy It Now price any time before your reserve is met or your listing ends.\nWhen a reserve or Buy It Now price is lowered, all bidders are notified by email, but we don’t tell them what the new price is. However, if you lower the reserve or Buy It Now price below the high bidder’s maximum bid, the high bidder’s maximum bid is lowered to $1.00 below the new reserve price. Your new reserve price is emailed to the high bidder. This allows the high bidder to confirm that they are still interested in the item. If you lower the Buy It Now price below the reserve price, the reserve price is lowered to the same amount as the new Buy It Now price.\nAdding a Buy It Now price\nYou can add a Buy It Now price after a listing has received bids. The new Buy It Now price can be any amount above the current high bid. This option only applies to reserve price listings that have not met the reserve price. You won’t be able to add a Buy It Now price if you list your vehicle locally. Vehicles listed locally only accept best offers.\nIf the new Buy It Now price is below the reserve price, the reserve price is lowered to the same amount as the new Buy It Now price. All bidders are notified by email that a Buy It Now price has been added. For the Parts & Accessories category only, the Buy It Now Price needs to be at least 10% higher than the starting price.\nRemoving your reserve price\nYou can only remove the reserve price if no bids have been placed on your listing. If bids have been placed, you can only lower your reserve price (see above).\nWhen the reserve price is removed, the next person to bid the highest amount will win the auction.\nHow to change your price\nFollow these steps to revise your vehicle’s price:\nFrom My eBay, select All Selling .\nIn the row for the item you want to change, from the Actions dropdown menu, select Revise .\nOn the Revise your listing page, make your changes. (Gray sections can’t be revised.)\nSelect Save and Continue , then select Submit Changes .\nOther terms and conditions\nWhen you lower the reserve price, the high bidder will need to confirm their interest in winning the item—they won’t automatically win the item, even if their bid was higher than the new reserve price. The high bidder may have bid on another vehicle when they didn’t initially meet your reserve price. If the high bidder still wants to purchase the vehicle, they’ll need to bid again at or above the new reserve price or use the Buy It Now option.\nEnding a listing early\nSee our page on Ending a listing for more information.\nOther terms and conditions\nYou’ll still be charged listing fees (such as an insertion fee and any optional feature fees) if you end your listing early, even if you don’t sell to the high bidder. If you want to change or improve your listing, consider revising your listing instead.\nSellers aren’t allowed to cancel bids and end listings early in order to avoid selling an item that did not meet the desired sale price. Although there are legitimate reasons for ending a listing early, abuse of this option will be investigated.\nWhen sellers list a vehicle on eBay Motors, they are also allowed to sell it locally, like in their local newspaper. If the vehicle sells locally, sellers are allowed to cancel all bids and end the listing early.\nPolicies and regulations\nSellers are responsible for reviewing applicable laws for their state and the buyer’s state and the Federal Trade Commission’s Used Car Rule - opens in new window or tab . These can include seller licensing rules, title requirements, emissions standards, and registration policies.\nBased on the physical location of the buyer or the seller, state consumer protection laws may apply to your transaction on eBay and may limit what you can legally sell. For information about your state’s motors regulations, please visit your local Department of Motor Vehicles website.\nReview our Vehicle, parts and accessories policy - opens in new window or tab for more information on what’s allowed and what’s not when listing on eBay Motors.\nSelling parts and accessories\nWhen you create a parts and accessories listing, we recommend adding parts compatibility (also known as “fitment”). This allows you to add all the years, makes, models, trims, and engines that your part fits (up to 3,000 combinations, depending on the category), which makes it easy for buyers to find the right parts for their vehicle.\nWhen you begin to list your item, we’ll show you your options in the compatibility section of the listing form. You can either choose a product with pre-filled compatibility information or manually enter compatible vehicles.\nUsing fitment can reduce returns due to fitment issues because it is more likely a buyer will get an item that will fit their vehicle. It also helps protect you in cases where it doesn't fit the buyer's vehicle after all. See below for more on how returns work for parts & accessories .\nIf you’re listing with variations , your compatibility information must apply to all your variations, because fitment doesn’t change between each variant.\nLearn more about parts compatibility listings - opens in new window or tab .\nTip Before you start creating a parts and accessories listing, visit the Parts & Accessories Seller Resource Center - opens in new window or tab : it’s full of information to help you make a sale.\nReturns\nVehicles Although vehicles do not require you to have a return policy, we encourage you to work with the buyer to reach a resolution when they want to return their purchase.\nParts & Accessories Whether the buyer has changed their mind or there's a problem with the item, it's important to respond promptly if they ask to return an item. If a buyer is returning an item because it doesn't match the listing description, or it doesn’t fit their vehicle, you’ll need to accept the return even if you have a no returns policy. For more information, read our article on handling return requests .\neBay Guaranteed Fit eBay checks buyer vehicle details against item compatibility information added by you. When there is a match, we'll cover the cost of an eBay return label if the buyer opens a return because the item doesn’t fit their vehicle (some exceptions may apply*).\n*If the item isn't eligible for an eBay return label, you'll be responsible for providing a way for the buyer to return the item.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Listing durations and timings \nHelp webpage description: When you list an item on eBay, you can choose a listing duration, which is the length of time it will show on our site. \nHelp webpage content: The length of time you can list for depends on the listing format you choose:\nListing duration options\nAuction-style format – 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. Unsold items may be automatically relisted\nFixed price format – Good ’Til Canceled. This means that the item will be relisted every month until it’s sold or until you end the listing\nTip To create a 1-day listing , you need to have a feedback score of at least 10. If you don’t meet this requirement, you won’t see the 1-day option.\nHow to select a listing duration\nTo set the listing duration for an auction-style listing in the quick listing tool:\nAt the bottom of the listing form, select Change beside your current listing preferences.\nCheck the Enable more options box and hit Save .\nIn the Pricing section, select Change .\nEnsure the Auction starting bid box is checked, and then select More options .\nFrom the Auction Duration dropdown, choose your preferred listing duration.\nFill in the rest of your listing, then select List item .\nTo choose a listing duration using the advanced listing tool :\nGo to the Pricing section.\nSelect the number of days from the Auction duration dropdown.\nTip When selecting a 1- or 3-day duration, you may see a message advising that, if your item doesn’t sell, we’ll relist it for you for free as a 7-day auction. See our article on relisting items for more information.\nGood ’Til Canceled Listings\nWhen you list an item as Good ’Til Canceled, it will relist every month on the same day until it’s sold. For example, if you list your item on the 1st of May, it will relist on the 1st of June.\nIf you list your item on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of a month, the duration will be adjusted if the following month is shorter, but will revert to the original day for longer months. For example, if you list an item on the 31st of May, it will relist on the 30th of June, and then again on the 31st of August and so on.\nScheduling listings\nYou can schedule listings to start on a day and time you choose, up to 3 weeks in advance, allowing you to create your listings at your convenience and control the time they start and end.\nTo schedule your listing in the quick listing tool:\nGo to the Pricing section of the listing tool.\nSelect Schedule your listing's start time . (If you don't see this option, select More options first.)\nSet a start date and time.\nTo schedule your listing in the advanced listing tool:\nGo to the Pricing section.\nSet Schedule your listing to on. (If you do not see this option, select See all options and set Scheduling to on first.)\nSet a start date and time.\nYou can view your scheduled items - opens in new window or tab in My eBay.\nTo reschedule or cancel a scheduled listing:\nGo to your scheduled items - opens in new window or tab .\nChoose the listing you want to change.\nSelect Reschedule to change the date and time or Delete to cancel the listing.\nTip Listing times on eBay.com are shown in Pacific time. You can view eBay’s official time - opens in new window or tab and a US time zone map to calculate the time in your area.\nListing times\nListings end in whole-day increments from the listing’s start time, so if you submit your listing at 1:14 p.m. on Sunday and select a 3-day listing, it will end at exactly 1:14 p.m. on Wednesday.\nListings that run during a daylight-saving time change will still receive the full amount of the listing duration. For example, if you have a 1-day listing that starts at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, and the daylight-saving time spring transition occurs that Saturday evening, the listing will end at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday."

Currently, eBay offers you six email templates that you can utilize for different occasions and marketing campaigns. We’ve added templates to enable you to provide sale events, volume pricing, coupon and order discounts to your customers, and drive traffic back to your store.

Scheduled emails will go out to recipients on the same day each week, every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks.\nSelect Review to preview your email before sending and then Activate to send your email.\nKeep in mind that your buyers can receive one newsletter from you every other week. Refresh the content frequently to encourage more buyers to open and click on your emails.

If you are a non-UK or non-EU seller with goods in the UK or EU, or you sell goods into the UK or EU, eBay will account for VAT under certain circumstances. \nHelp webpage content: What is VAT?\nVAT is a tax on consumer spending. When a VAT registered seller makes sales within the UK or EU, they are obliged to collect VAT based on the delivery country of their goods. This VAT must be passed on to the national tax authorities via periodic VAT return filings.\nIn most countries it is possible to register for VAT online, and to complete your VAT filings through the local tax authority's website.\nIn practice, the following situations will normally trigger mandatory VAT registration in the UK or the EU:\nSales of goods which exceed a locally defined threshold. Note that thresholds vary from country to country and do not generally apply to overseas or non-established sellers. If a seller is selling goods domestically, they should check the threshold with their tax authorities or a local tax advisor.\nSales of goods from a local warehouse, by a non-resident seller (forward deployed inventory).\nSales of digital or eservices to private individuals.\nFor the EU only, cross-border sales in excess of the EUR 10,000 intra-EU threshold.\nIf you are an EU-based seller who makes sales to non-VAT registered buyers in any EU countries, and the combined total of those sales exceeds EUR 10,000, you will need to collect VAT in all EU countries based on the delivery address. To do this you will either have to register for VAT in each of the EU countries where you make sales, or use the EU VAT One Stop Shop .\nMore information can be found at the following sites:\nUK: VAT registration ; Businesses selling goods in the UK using online marketplaces\nEU: Information for online sellers\nIt is mandatory that you display your VAT identification number on the eBay site in connection with your listings.

Invoices will include the VAT amount collected by eBay. eBay will remit this VAT amount to the responsible tax authorities under the entity name eBay Marketplaces GmbH.

If you do not want your item to be sold to buyers internationally, you can exclude countries or regions you don't want to ship to by adjusting your shipping settings.

Buyer obligations: Customs fees and duties and delegation of authority\nBuyers are responsible for customs fees and duties on items shipped internationally in accordance with local laws and regulations.

You can also find more information in our full article below.\nI don't accept returns, why do I have to pay for a return shipping label?\nIf the buyer is returning an item because it's damaged, faulty, or didn't match your listing description, the eBay Money Back Guarantee allows them to return it for free. That means that you'll need to accept the return and cover the cost of return shipping, even if you don't normally offer returns.\neBay may automatically accept a return request from a buyer on your behalf if an eBay shipping label is available. Once you've received the item, you have 2 business days to review and issue a refund, or ask eBay to step in and help .\nWhat happens if the item is damaged while it's being returned?\nWhen returning an item, it's the buyer's responsibility to ensure that it's packed properly and protected during shipping. If the item is damaged while it's being returned to you, you may qualify to deduct an amount from the buyer's refund .\nWhat happens if the item is lost while it's being returned?\nIn general, whoever pays for return shipping is responsible for ensuring the item arrives at its destination. If you paid for the return shipping, you'll need to work with the shipping carrier to try and find the item. If the buyer paid, they’ll need to contact the carrier instead.\nWhat happens if the buyer refuses to pay for return shipping?\nWho's responsible for return shipping costs depends on why the item is being returned. If the buyer is returning the item because it's damaged, faulty, or didn't match your listing description, then you're responsible for the return shipping costs, even if your returns policy says you don't offer free returns.\nIf the buyer is sending the item back for another reason, for instance, if they ordered the wrong item or changed their mind, then they’ll need to pay for return shipping, unless your returns policy states you offer free returns.\nIf the buyer is responsible for return shipping costs, and they refuse to pay, you can ask us to step in and help resolve the issue.\nIf the buyer is sending an item back because it doesn’t match the listing description or it arrived damaged or faulty, you’re responsible for the cost of return shipping, even if you don’t offer returns.\nIf they simply changed their mind or ordered the wrong item, who pays for return shipping is determined by your return policy. If you stated you offer free returns, you have to pay; otherwise, you can ask the buyer to cover the cost.\nTip We recommend using a tracked service for return shipping. Tracking lets you know the item is on its way, and eBay can see the progress of the return in case we’re asked to step in. When you use an eBay label, tracking is automatically included.\nReturn shipping options\nWhen you’re responsible for return shipping, you can choose from a number of options in the return request form. To get to the return request form, go to your Returns dashboard - opens in new window or tab and select View return details . If you’ve accepted the buyer’s return or offered to send them a replacement, you can choose one of the following options to let them ship the item back to you.\nSend an eBay shipping label\nIf the package meets the size requirements set by the return carrier, you can purchase a return shipping label through the return request and send it to your buyer. They can then print the label and use it to send the item back to you.\nHere’s how to send an eBay shipping label from the View return details section:\nSelect Send an eBay shipping label .\nConfirm your return address on the label.\nReturn shipping labels don’t include insurance. If you want return shipping to be insured, see our section on alternative return shipping options .\nReturn shipping costs when you use an eBay label\nWhen the buyer is returning the item to you, the cost of the label will be charged to your account once it’s scanned by the carrier. We may ask you to accept a billing agreement to authorize payment for these kinds of charges. If the buyer doesn’t use the return shipping label, you are not charged for the cost of the label.\nAny time you use an eBay return shipping label, eBay will automatically select the cheapest return option for your item.\nIn some instances, return shipping charges are estimated rather than based on the actual weight of the package. These charges are based on rates negotiated by eBay, and are typically less than what you would pay the carrier for the same item.\nIf the expected shipping charges exceed the expected refund or the refund value of a replacement or exchange, an eBay return shipping label won’t be available.\nProvide your own pre-paid label\nIf you’d rather the buyer use your preferred shipping carrier for return shipping, or if an eBay label isn’t available, you can provide your own return label.\nWhen using your own carrier, make sure to upload the label and tracking details to the buyer’s return request. For items that have a total cost of $750 or more, signature confirmation is required.\nHere’s how to send your own label from the View return details section:\nSelect Upload a shipping label and then the upload image icon.\nChoose the label you want to send to your buyer.\nSelect your carrier and enter the tracking number.\nShipping labels for international returns\nLanguage barriers may make it difficult to purchase an international return label. If you’re unsure, try contacting the buyer to ask if they’ll purchase an international label on your behalf.\nIf they agree, you need to send funds to cover the cost . Ensure the buyer uses a tracked service and includes signature confirmation for items with a total cost of $750 or more.\nInternational returns and customs\nIf you’re sending funds to cover the shipping cost, the buyer is required to fill out the customs forms.\nTo ensure there are no delays with your return, provide the necessary customs information to the buyer. Double check that your information is correct; falsifying a customs form is against the law and eBay policy .\nSince you’re the recipient of the parcel, you are responsible for paying any customs, brokerage, service charges, or duty fees.\nAsk the buyer to use a label you sent along with the item\nIf you included a return shipping label with the item when you sent it to the buyer, you can let them know that they should use that to send it back to you.\nHere’s how you can let the buyer know about the label from the View return details section:\nSelect your carrier and enter the tracking number.\nAdd a message to the buyer.\nTick the box beside I provided a return label with the original item .\nOffer to send funds for the return shipping cost\nUse the carrier’s shipping calculator to find out how much return shipping will cost. If you’re unable to determine the cost, contact the buyer and ask them to provide a quote.\nEnsure that the amount includes tracking, and on items that have a total cost of $750 or more, include signature confirmation.\nHow to send funds to the buyer:\nContact the buyer through eBay Messages , and ask how they would like to receive funds to purchase a return label.\nSend the funds using the buyer's preferred method.\nAsk the buyer to confirm that they’ve received the funds and to upload tracking to the return request so you can see that the item is on its way.\nAccommodate the return another way\nIf you prefer, you can provide the buyer with another method of returning the item. For instance, you can offer to pick up the item in person or let them drop the item off at your closest store. If you want to provide an alternative method of returning the item, simply select Confirm you will facilitate the return from the View return details section.\nReturn an item with alternative shipping arrangements\nSometimes returning an item may require additional, alternative shipping arrangements, such as:\nShipping a return with insurance: Insurance isn’t available for return shipments that use eBay labels. If you or the buyer prefer that an item be returned with insurance, purchase your own return postage with insurance instead of using the return shipping label provided.\nReturning multiple packages: For each return requested through My eBay, we generally provide one return shipping label. If the buyer finds that they need multiple return shipping labels to ship multiple packages back to you, ask them to contact you to make alternative shipping arrangements for the packages.\nItem is outside eBay guidelines: An eBay return shipping label is only available for items within certain size and weight guidelines. If the package is outside of these guidelines, you need to make alternative shipping arrangements.\nItem was originally delivered by freight or local pickup: When you’re responsible for return shipping costs and you need to make alternative shipping arrangements, speak to the buyer to agree on the service and cost before they send the item. Make sure that they include the packing slip, tracking, and for items that have a total cost of $750 or more, signature confirmation.\nWhen the buyer wants to return an item using alternative shipping arrangements and you’re responsible for the return shipping charges, they’ll need to work with you to agree on the shipping service and cost before returning the item.\nIf the buyer uses alternative shipping arrangements, the return shipping charges aren’t included in any eBay Money Back Guarantee refunds, even if you agreed to pay return shipping charges."

Additionally, you may need to make some changes in how you communicate with buyers and how you process any personal information that you collect.\nIf you’re a seller based outside of the EU but make your items available to EU buyers, you also need to understand and comply with GDPR. If you don’t sell to buyers based in the EU, then no action is required.\nKeep in mind that the penalties for non-compliance with GDPR can be significant—according to EU rules this can be up to €20m or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater. Under the new law, EU residents can also initiate class-action lawsuits related to the protection and usage of their personal information, so it’s important that you understand and comply with the rules.\nYou’ll find everything you need to know about GDPR and the steps you need to take in how you collect and process any personal information at the EU’s official GDPR website - opens in new window or tab .\nHow eBay prepared for GDPR\nWe updated our User Privacy Notice and our Privacy Center - opens in new window or tab to highlight some of the work we did to get ready for GDPR.

For several years, our policy has been to allow users worldwide to access the personal information that we have about them, even when we have no legal requirement to do so. This policy remains so users outside of the EU can also request this information from us.\nImplemented processes to fulfill the rights of users in the EU, which include access, modification, and deletion of their personal information within one month.\nRedesigned our registration process and privacy consent experience in our products to be more transparent and provide our users with more control.\nRolled out privacy-by-design training to teams to incorporate privacy minimization concepts into our engineering processes and to identify areas where we can improve privacy protections within existing products and services."

        "content": "Help webpage title: Service metrics policy \nHelp webpage description: Our service metrics are intended to help sellers provide a great experience for all buyers. We provide detailed insights and peer benchmarks to indicate how well you're performing compared to others with a similar selling profile. \nHelp webpage content: This page describes our service metrics program. We also evaluate individual performance for all sellers against our minimum seller standards .\nEvery month we take a look at how many times your buyers reported that they didn't receive an item or requested a return because their item wasn't as described. We count all opened cases because even if you resolved the issue promptly, it indicates that the transaction didn't go as smoothly for the buyer as it could have.\nThere are many factors which can influence the number of cases in your service metrics (such as types of items or seasonality), so we don't set limits for these. Instead, we take the average rates from other sellers with similar sales activity – or \"peers\" – as a benchmark to evaluate your performance. We also have some safeguards in place to protect sellers and ensure fair evaluation.\nIt's important to check your service metrics regularly so that you can see how you compare to other sellers. Use the button below to see details of your service metrics, including your projected rate for the next evaluation. Note that this projection may change if more cases are opened.\nIf your rates of 'Item not received' or 'Item not as described' have increased, or are considered high compared to your peers, it's important to focus on minimizing these issues as soon as possible – this will help to improve your rating at the next evaluation. For more help, read our article on Monitoring and improving your seller performance .\nWe'll only calculate service metrics for you if we have enough data. Depending on how much you sell, you may not see service metrics for all your categories, or we may not show any data in your service metrics dashboard at all.\nWhat is the policy?\nSellers are expected to minimize the number of times that their buyers either:\nReport that an item hasn't arrived\nRequest a return because an item doesn't match the listing\nRather than simply measuring these as a percentage of your sales, we compare your rates to those of sellers with similar items, prices, shipping options and terms of sale on the same eBay site.\nYour service metrics are evaluated on the 20th of each month to determine whether your rates of buyers reporting a problem are Low, Average, High or Very High compared to your peers.\nOther eBay members can't see your service metrics. We may place some limitations on your selling activity , including extended delivery dates or higher final value fees, if you are evaluated as Very High.\nService metrics are provided for your listings on eBay.com as well as a number of other eBay sites. For more information about how your performance is evaluated when selling internationally, please read our Global seller performance policy .\nHow we benchmark seller performance\nOn the 20th of each month, we take a look at your recent transactions to work out your service metrics and peer benchmark .\nTo make sure we're getting a fair picture, we'll adjust how far we look back (the \"evaluation period\") depending on how much you've sold recently:\nIf you had more than 400 transactions in the past 3 months, we'll count all those transactions\nIf you had fewer than 400 transactions in the past 3 months, we'll count all your transactions from the last 12 months\nTo help understand how evaluations work, please see our calculation examples below.\nService metrics and peer benchmark\nFor your service metrics , we count how many times your buyers have either:\nReported that an item hasn't arrived\nRequested a return because an item doesn't match the listing\nPeer benchmarking means we look at how your rates compare with those of other sellers who have similar sales activity, items and business policies.\nService metric\nWhat it means\nWho we compare against\n'Item not received' rate\nThe percentage of your transactions where a buyer reported that the item didn't arrive or was not available for collection\nOther sellers who:\nHave a comparable volume of transactions, with the same evaluation period\nSell items on the same eBay site with a similar price\nShip to the same destinations with similar expected delivery timeframes\n'Item not as described' return rate\nThe percentage of your transactions where a buyer requested a return because the item doesn't match the listing description\nOther sellers who:\nHave a comparable volume of transactions, with the same evaluation period\nSell items in the same categories as you with a similar price and item condition\nHave similar return policies and delivery time frames\nShipping categories\nWhen comparing 'Item not received' rates, we take into account where sellers are shipping their items:\nDomestic: The item location and shipping address are in the same country\nInternational – Matured region: The shipping address is in one of the following regions: United States and its territories Canada Australia China Hong Kong Taiwan Japan New Zealand South Korea Israel United Arab Emirates Singapore Most European countries and British Territories\nUnited States and its territories\nCanada\nAustralia\nChina\nHong Kong\nTaiwan\nJapan\nNew Zealand\nSouth Korea\nIsrael\nUnited Arab Emirates\nSingapore\nMost European countries and British Territories\nInternational – Emerging region: The shipping address is neither 'Domestic' nor 'International: Matured region'\nCalculation examples\nThese examples illustrate how we compare and evaluate sellers for each type of service metric.\nSee 'Item not received' service metrics example\nKathryn runs a boutique pre-loved fashion business on eBay.

To see what you can do to bring your rates back down, read our article on Monitoring and improving your seller performance .\nSome limitations are applied straight away after the evaluation, while others take effect from the 1st of the following month. If your service metrics rating improves at a future evaluation, the same time frames will apply for limitations to be removed.\nVery High 'Item not received' rate\nDirectly after the evaluation:\nFor the shipping categories where you are currently evaluated as Very High, we may add extra time when showing buyers an expected delivery date for your items\nFunds from your orders may be placed on hold until tracking information shows that the item is on its way to the buyer\nYou may be unable to deduct an amount from the buyer's refund if an item is returned used or damaged\nVery High 'Item not as described' rate\nDirectly after the evaluation:\nYou may be unable to deduct an amount from the buyer's refund if an item is returned used or damaged\nFrom the 1st day of the month following the evaluation:\nYou may be charged higher final value fees. For full details, please see our fees pages: Selling fees Store selling fees\nSelling fees\nStore selling fees\nFair evaluation, seller protections and appeals\nOur service metrics are in place to protect the interests of all users, and are intended to look at your performance in context, rather than being specific to individual transactions. We understand that some types of items will see more returns than others, and that international deliveries usually take longer than domestic ones. Peer benchmarking helps us identify sellers whose rates of 'Item not received' reports or 'Item not as described' returns are statistical outliers.\nFair evaluation\nTo ensure your ratings are based on valid statistics and fair comparisons, and that we only place limitations on selling activity when significant differences are identified:\nWe only benchmark you against sellers with similar sales activity, items and business policies (see How we benchmark performance )\nWe may adjust a rating in certain circumstances so that it won't affect your account. When we do this, you'll see a message in the service metrics dashboard. For example: Your sales have grown and you've changed from a 12-month to a 3-month evaluation period and peer group. If this results in your rating becoming Very High, we'll adjust your rating and limitations won't apply for one evaluation cycle A service metric rating is High or Very High, but the rate of reports/requests is less than 1% of transactions\nYour sales have grown and you've changed from a 12-month to a 3-month evaluation period and peer group. If this results in your rating becoming Very High, we'll adjust your rating and limitations won't apply for one evaluation cycle\nA service metric rating is High or Very High, but the rate of reports/requests is less than 1% of transactions\nA Very High rating won't affect your account unless it involves at least 10 reports/requests with 10 unique buyers\nSeller protections\nWe have safeguards in place to protect your ratings and help you in case you have a problem. For example:\nIf we determine that a buyer has violated our Abusive buyer policy , we'll automatically remove any 'Item not received' reports or 'Item not as described' return requests they had filed from service metrics\nWe may extend expected delivery dates and/or remove 'Item not received' reports from service metrics when things happen that cause widespread delays, such as severe weather or carrier disruptions\nWhile these protections are available to all sellers, some of our other protections are dependent on meeting specific eligibility and/or seller performance criteria. Learn more about our seller protections .\nAppeals\nWe'll only remove 'Item not received' reports or 'Item not as described' return requests from your service metrics when they fall under our automated seller protections .\nAs described above, your service metrics ratings need to be statistically meaningful and substantially worse than your peer group in order for limitations to be applied, so individual reports/requests shouldn't adversely affect your account standing.\nIf you believe a buyer is not following our policies, you can report the buyer - opens in new window or tab and we'll look into it."

Whether the tax is included in the listing price, added at checkout, charged at the border, or paid directly by the buyer depends on the seller's status, the order price, the item's location, and your shipping address. \nHelp webpage content: Are you a seller looking for information about tax on your eBay sales? Read our article on taxes and import charges for sellers .\nWhen you buy an item, taxes may be applicable to your purchase and may vary depending on a variety of factors, such as:\nPrice of the item\nNature of the item\nDelivery address of your order\nMany organizations and groups qualify as exempt from sales tax and may make purchases on eBay without paying sales tax. To find out more about our Buyer Exemption program, and to claim your sales tax exemption, take a look below .\nTip Even if you live in a state that does not impose a sales tax, you may still see tax calculated on your order if it is shipped to a state that does impose a tax. Similarly, sales tax may still be applicable if you live outside of the United States.\nItems delivered to a United States address\nFor items shipped to a US address, the tax responsibility falls into the following three categories:\nMarketplace responsibility\nMarketplace responsibility refers to states where eBay collects and remits sales tax on behalf of sellers.\nIf your shipping address is in one of the marketplace responsibility states within the US, applicable sales tax will be collected by eBay and included in the order total at checkout. To find out if your address is in a marketplace responsibility state, you can find the full list of states below .\nSeller responsibility\nIf your shipping address isn't in one of the marketplace responsibility states, but the seller has a responsibility to charge sales tax, eBay provides certain tools to sellers where the applicable taxes may be included at checkout. We recommend you consult your tax advisor.\nBuyer responsibility\nIf neither eBay nor the seller is required to collect sales tax on your purchase, you may be required to pay taxes directly to the state or your local tax authority. For more information we recommend that you consult with your tax advisor.\nTip In addition to any applicable sales or use taxes, if your purchase is shipped into the US from another country, you may have to pay duties and customs processing fees. These additional amounts may need to be paid to either the customs authority, or to the entity handling your shipment (e.g. US Postal Service). Take a look at our article on international purchases and shipping for more details.\neBay's Buyer Exemption program for sales tax\nIf you are a tax-exempt buyer, we have a buyer exemption system that allows you to submit sales tax exemption certificates to eBay and make purchases without paying sales tax.\nAlternatively, you may be able to get a credit for sales tax paid to eBay directly from your state. However, you should consult a tax advisor or contact the Department of Revenue for your state for further details as policies are different for each state.\nClaiming sales tax exemption for your eBay purchases\nThe documentation required for tax exemption can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Use the dropdown menus below to see documentation required for your jurisdiction.\nIf your state requires you to submit a \"Multistate Tax Commission (MTC)\" form or a \"Streamlined Sales Tax (SST)\" form, you can find them by following the links below:\nDownload MTC form - opens in new window or tab\nDownload SST form - opens in new window or tab\nTo upload your documentation, use the Upload documents button below.\nPlease allow 5 business days for processing.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Monitoring and improving your seller performance \nHelp webpage description: Our seller performance dashboards help you monitor how you're doing on some key basics – sending orders promptly, ensuring buyers get the item they ordered, and resolving any issues. \nHelp webpage content: Reviewing your metrics regularly and taking steps to improve your seller performance can have benefits across your business.\nUse the buttons below to review your performance metrics:\nTip Some service metrics may not be shown in your dashboard if you haven't had enough transactions.\nWhy seller performance matters\nBuyers should have a great experience on eBay, every time. If an order is canceled unexpectedly or an issue isn't resolved, it can significantly affect that person's trust in the seller, and make them less likely to come back to eBay. And although most sellers are great at sorting out problems with orders, avoiding situations where the buyer doesn't receive the item they were expecting is even better.\nFor these reasons, we have some minimum expectations for all sellers on eBay, and we monitor each seller's level of service relative to others with a similar selling profile. The performance metrics we provide are intended to encourage good selling practices which establish buyer confidence in you and in eBay.\nHow seller evaluations work\nOn the 20th of each month, we look back at the past 3 months or 12 months, depending on how many transactions you had, and calculate your performance on the areas detailed below.\nBased on these, you're assigned a seller level which indicates your individual performance, and a service metrics rating which indicates how well you're preventing buyer issues, compared to sellers with similar sales activity.\nAbout seller levels\nSeller level\nWhat it means\nHow it affects your account\nTop Rated\nYou're meeting higher standards, as well as some other requirements.\nOther eBay members see \"Top Rated\" on your feedback profile.\nAbove Standard\nYou're meeting or exceeding our minimum standards.\nYou can carry on selling on eBay as normal.\nBelow Standard\nYou're not meeting one or more of the minimum performance requirements for sellers.\nWe may place limitations on your selling activity – including higher final value fees – until your performance improves.\nFor full details of how we calculate your seller level and our requirements for sellers, see our Seller standards policy .\nAbout service metrics ratings\nRating\nWhat it means\nHow it affects your account\nLow\nYou're performing better than most of your peers in making sure that buyers receive their orders promptly, and in setting and meeting buyers' expectations about your items.\nYou can carry on selling on eBay as normal.\nAverage\nYou're performing as well as your peers, but you may have opportunities to reduce preventable requests.\nYou can carry on selling, but you should consider taking some time to review your metrics in depth.\nHigh\nYou're not performing as well as your peers in ensuring your buyers received their orders as expected.\nFocus on minimizing 'Not as described' returns and 'Item not received' reports as soon as possible – this will help to reduce your percentage rates at the next evaluation.\nVery High\nYour rates of 'Item not received' reports or 'Item not as described' returns are significantly worse than those of your peers.\nWe may place limitations on your selling activity – including extending delivery dates or charging higher final value fees – until your performance improves.\nFor full details of how we calculate your service metrics and peer benchmark, see our Service metrics policy .\nTip If you sell in multiple categories and/or offer international shipping, you may have multiple 'Item not received' and 'Item not as described' ratings, because we compare those transactions with different peer groups.\nMonitor your performance\nWe have two different seller dashboards to showcase your performance criteria and help you identify areas where you can improve.\nWhat's expected of all sellers\nHow we measure it\nWhere to review your performance\nSending items promptly\nLate shipment rate This is the percentage of your orders which were not sent on time.\nSeller standards dashboard - opens in new window or tab\nEnsuring the buyer gets the item they ordered\nTransaction defect rate This includes the number of orders which you chose to cancel (for example, because you ran out of stock).\nSeller standards dashboard - opens in new window or tab\nService metrics and peer benchmark These indicate how your rates of 'Item not received' and 'Item not as described' requests compare to other sellers like you.\nService metrics dashboard - opens in new window or tab\nResolving buyer issues promptly\nCases closed without seller resolution This is the number of your sales where there was an 'Item not received' or 'Item not as described' request, but you didn't resolve it.\nSeller standards dashboard - opens in new window or tab\nKeep in mind that a case closed without seller resolution also counts as a transaction defect. That's because it's really important that sellers resolve problems for their buyers.\nHow to improve your performance\nWe encourage all sellers to take time to review their performance metrics in detail and see what they need to focus on. Making changes to the way you do things on eBay can help reduce time spent handling buyer queries and resolving issues. In addition, it can lead to more sales and overall smoother running of your business.\nAccurate and complete listings can reduce 'Item not as described' returns\nTaking the time to improve your listings may also help increase listing visibility , boost sales and reduce the number of questions you receive from buyers. Get more tips on creating a listing .\nTip If you sell a lot, use the categories in your service metrics dashboard to help you prioritize which listings to review. It's also a good idea to check the listings of your best-selling products regularly, since they make up a high proportion of your sales.\nStreamlining shipping can reduce late shipments and 'Item not received' reports\nOnline shoppers want quick and reliable delivery, so it's important to set the right expectations and fulfill accordingly. Updating your shipping options may also help make your listings more competitive and reduce questions from buyers, and using tracking can help protect you in an eBay Money Back Guarantee case or payment dispute.\nKeep stock levels updated on eBay to avoid order cancellations\nCanceling a buyer's order because you can't send the item will result in a transaction defect, so it's important to keep your listing quantities in sync with your stock levels. Learn more about using the out-of-stock option on multi-quantity listings .\nSet up Time Away to avoid late shipments and 'Item not received' requests\nTaking time off from your business doesn't have to affect your seller performance. Whether you're planning a break or managing an unexpected disruption, you can set up Time Away to avoid disappointing buyers.\nTip Make sure you fulfill any orders and respond to any buyer requests for items sold before your time away start date.\nBe ready to handle returns\nOffering returns helps buyers feel confident when shopping online. And making it easy for a buyer to return something is great customer service that will keep them coming back to eBay. Even if you choose not to offer returns, under eBay Money Back Guarantee , the buyer can still return an item if it doesn't match the listing. Learn more about setting up your return policy .\nResolve buyer issues promptly to avoid 'cases closed without seller resolution'\nEven when you work hard to get it right for your buyers, not every order will go smoothly. The service you provide when something goes wrong can significantly affect the buyer's willingness to shop on eBay again. Responding promptly to buyers and resolving their concerns may also help avoid negative feedback. Learn more about handling buyer issues ."

You earn 2 free listings bundles, which is 20,000 free fixed price listings.\nYour free listings are based on the number of completed transactions above a 3,000 minimum threshold during the month. In this case, you have 600 completed transactions above the minimum threshold (3,600 - 3,000 = 600)\nYou earn 1 free listing bundle for every 300 listings above the minimum threshold. In this case, you'll earn 2 free listings bundles (600/300 = 2)\nEach free listings bundle entitles you to 10,000 free fixed price listings to be used the following month. In this case, you'll earn 20,000 free listings (2 x 10,000 = 20,000) to be used in the month of October. They will expire on October 31. This is in addition to the 100,000 free fixed price listings you receive as part of your Enterprise Store subscription\nFinal value fees\nWe charge one final value fee when your item sells, and you don't have to worry about third-party payment processing fees. This fee is calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale, plus a per order fee. For orders $10.00 or less the per order fee is $0.30, for orders over $10.00 the per order fee is $0.40.\nThe total amount of the sale includes the item price, any handling charges, any shipping costs collected from the buyer (some exceptions apply ), sales tax , and any other applicable fees.\nAn order is defined as any number of items purchased by the same buyer at checkout with the same shipping method.\nIf you need to refund the buyer or cancel the sale, you may be eligible for fee credits as per our fee credits policy.\nPlease note that we charge different fees for non-Store sellers and different fees for selling vehicles in our Motors category.\nExceptions to how we calculate the final value fee on shipping\nIf you offer 1-day or international shipping as well as a cheaper or free option (like domestic shipping), the total amount of the sale is calculated based on the cheapest domestic option you offer.

In this situation, the total amount of the sale is determined as follows:\nAuction-style listing format: The total amount of the sale is the auction start price, the Buy It Now price (if applicable), the reserve price (if applicable), or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is highest.\nFixed price listing format: The total amount of the sale is the fixed price or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is higher.\nSellers not meeting performance expectations\nAdditional final value fees may apply on sales in the following circumstances:\nIf your account doesn't meet our minimum seller performance standards for the US in the evaluation on the 20th of the month, you'll be charged an additional 6% on the final value fees applicable to sales in the following calendar month. Go to your Seller Dashboard - opens in new window or tab to check your current seller level. This fee does not apply to Above Standard and eBay Top-rated Sellers\nIf your rate of 'Item not as described' return requests is evaluated in your service metrics - opens in new window or tab as Very High in the evaluation on the 20th of the month in one or more categories, you will be charged an additional 5% on the final value fees for sales in those categories in the following calendar month. You can view your personalized service metrics on your Service Metrics dashboard - opens in new window or tab in Seller Hub.\nAny additional final value fees will be calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale. We'll indicate which listings are subject to additional fees on your Account Summary - opens in new window or tab .\nNote: If your account isn't meeting our minimum seller performance standards and you're rated Very High in your rate of 'Item not as described' return requests, you'll only be charged the additional final value fee for not meeting our minimum seller performance standards.\nDispute fee\nIf you are found responsible for a disputed amount as per eBay policies (for example, a chargeback), we charge a $20.00 dispute fee, excluding sales tax, for each dispute.\nInternational fee\nIf your registered address is in the US and you offer eBay International Shipping - opens in new window or tab for your eligible listings, you won't be charged an international fee when your eligible item sells.\nIf you're not using eBay International Shipping to ship your item, we charge an international fee if either:\nThe delivery address for the item (entered by the buyer during checkout) is outside the US, or\nThe buyer's registered address is outside the US (regardless of the delivery address for the item)\nThis fee is calculated as 1.65% of the total amount of the sale and is automatically deducted from your sales.\nIf your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country or region of residence for your international fee information.\nSeller currency conversion charge\nWhen you create listings or sell items on an international eBay site, eBay may convert your funds to a different currency in order to collect amounts owed by you to eBay, or to payout funds due to you.\nFor example, if your registered address is in the US and you create a listing on eBay.de for which fees are due (such as insertion and/or optional listing upgrade fees), eBay will convert your funds from USD to EUR using the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of listing, in order to collect these fees. When the item sells on eBay.de, eBay will calculate your payout amount by converting the sales proceeds from EUR to USD using the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the sale.\nIf eBay converts your funds, the conversion will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. eBay's transaction exchange rate is composed of a base exchange rate plus a conversion charge. The conversion charge is a fixed percentage applied to the base exchange rate and retained by eBay. The base exchange rate reflects rates within the wholesale currency markets applicable to the currency pairing on the day of the conversion, or the prior business day. If exchange rates are set by law or regulation, the base exchange rate reflects the government reference rates.\nIf your registered address is in the US, the seller currency conversion charge applied and retained by eBay is 3%. If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country or region of residence for your seller currency conversion charge information.\nExamples of fee calculations\nAuction-style listing example\nYou're a Basic Store subscriber and you're selling a handbag using a 10-day duration.

The selling fees and other costs are automatically deducted, and your sales proceeds will show as Processing funds .\nIt typically takes 1-2 days from confirming the buyer’s payment for the sales proceeds to appear as Available for payout , unless the transaction was placed on hold , in which case it may take longer. To check if any of your payouts are on hold, select the button below:\nCheck payout holds\nIt typically takes 2 days from confirming the buyer’s payment to initiate your payout if your payouts are scheduled daily. If your payouts are scheduled weekly, we initiate payouts on Tuesday for the sales you've made from Monday to Sunday the previous week. If your payouts are scheduled biweekly, we'll initiate payouts every second Tuesday. If they're scheduled monthly, we’ll initiate them on the first Tuesday of every month. Your payouts will appear as Funds sent and it typically takes another 1-3 business days for the funds to clear in your checking account and become available to you.\nThis timeline is similar to the time it can take a credit card company to process your monthly payment, and depends on the processes of your financial institution\nAfter the payout is initiated, the funds are no longer with eBay\nIf you choose your Visa or Mastercard debit card as preferred for scheduled payouts, funds will arrive as per your payout schedule.\nTip Eligible sellers have the option to receive payouts to a verified Visa or Mastercard debit card for an additional fee. Payouts on demand to your debit card typically arrive within 30 minutes.

For example, if the buyer's order is confirmed on Sunday, and the holiday is on Monday, the payout will be initiated on Wednesday (3 days later).\nIf your payout is scheduled weekly, a banking holiday may delay your payout by up to 8 days. For example, if the buyer's order is confirmed on Friday, and the holiday is on Monday, the payout will be initiated on the Tuesday of the following week (8 days later).\nTip You must add a checking account to receive your funds. You can't use a savings account or a PayPal account to receive payouts.\nHow weekends affect your payouts\nIf you receive payouts to your checking account, any payouts you receive Friday-Sunday will be processed on Monday for settlement to your bank account.\nTip You can still withdraw funds on weekends using your Visa or Mastercard debit card.\nHow to change your payout schedule\nBy default, payouts are initiated daily, but you can also change to weekly, biweekly or monthly payouts.\nDaily payouts are initiated Monday through Sunday and include any funds that have become Available for payout during the previous 24 hours\nWeekly payouts are initiated on Tuesdays and include any funds that have become Available for payout Monday through Sunday of the previous week\nBiweekly payouts are initiated every second Tuesday and include any funds that have become available for payout on Monday from the last two weeks\nMonthly payouts are initiated on the first Tuesday of every month, and include any funds that have become available for payout on Monday from the previous month\nHere's how to change your payout schedule in Seller Hub:\nGo to the Payments tab - opens in new window or tab in Seller Hub.\nSelect Payout Settings .\nChange the frequency of your payouts from daily to weekly, biweekly, or monthly as needed.\nYou can also change your payout schedule in Payments - opens in new window or tab in My eBay.\nTip If the buyer pays in a currency that's different to your payout currency, the payment will be converted to your payout currency.

This exchange rate will apply in the event of a refund.\nTracking your payouts\nTracking your payouts is simple. We’ll send you an email to let you know that we’ve initiated a payout. Additionally, each payout has its own unique Payout ID - opens in new window or tab , making it easy for you to keep track of your funds.\nWe also provide a bank reference ID for each payout, so you can track your payouts with your bank if you need to. You can find your bank reference ID in Payout details in Seller Hub.\nPayout statuses\nHere's an explanation of each payout status:\nCreated : A Payout ID has been created and the payout process has started\nIn progress : The payout has been initiated by eBay and is in the process of being sent to your bank\nFunds sent : Your payout is successful. eBay has sent your payout, it could take 1-3 business days for your bank to process the funds to your checking account\nReturned : The payout has been initiated by eBay, but an issue has occurred with your bank or eBay\nBlocked : Your payout method could be invalid, or may have been blocked by eBay\nCanceled : Your payout was unsuccessful, and the balance has been added back to your Available funds\nWhat to do if payouts fail\nIf your payouts are showing as Returned or Blocked , your bank information may be incorrect or you may need to verify additional information before we can initiate payouts to your account.

        "content": "Help webpage title: Payments on hold \nHelp webpage description: We know it's important that you receive your money as quickly as possible. However, we may sometimes need to put a hold on your funds due to your selling history or performance, or to address disputes. This helps us keep eBay a safe marketplace for buyers and sellers. \nHelp webpage content: In most cases, holds are lifted when a buyer confirms they’ve received their item or when a case is resolved.\nTo check the date when a payment is expected to be available, select the button below:\nCheck payment holds\nTo help ensure eBay remains a safe place to buy and sell, and to meet our legal and compliance obligations - opens in new window or tab , we sometimes place a hold on funds, for example, if there's an open case or dispute on a transaction, if your buyer reports a problem with the order, if your account is restricted or suspended, if you owe eBay money, or if you're a new or infrequent seller. If we placed a hold on your funds, we'll notify you by email and, depending on the reason, may request additional information from you to help resolve the issue.\nThere are various reasons why we may place a hold on your funds.\nTransaction holds\nTransaction holds are when we place a hold on funds related to a particular buyer transaction. The funds on hold may be used to refund the buyer for the same transaction.\nWhile proceeds from your sales typically become available within 2 days of confirming the buyer’s payment, we may place a transaction hold on funds while we ensure a successful transaction. To reduce the likelihood of a transaction hold, we recommend shipping an item the same day your buyer pays for it and following good shipping practices, such as adding tracking information to your order.\nTip If we place a hold on your funds, it will usually be resolved within 30 days, but in rare circumstances it may take longer. For most orders, adding tracking information can help you receive your funds faster.\nAdditionally, we may place a transaction hold on funds depending on your seller status, changes to your account status, or other factors we use to help ensure a safe marketplace in all categories, regardless of whether the transaction is covered by our eBay Money Back Guarantee or not:\nNew or infrequent sellers will experience transaction holds while learning best selling practices. This helps sellers become established and build a strong selling history on eBay. New sellers typically experience holds for up to 30 days, although sometimes it may be longer\nPreviously restricted or suspended sellers will experience transaction holds for the 30 days after the restriction or suspension is lifted, while we confirm that the items have been successfully delivered\nHigh priced items or unusual selling patterns may lead to transaction holds for up to 30 days to help us ensure that buyers don't have any issues with the order\nThe authentication process may lead to transaction holds for up to 30 days until the authenticity of items sold with eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee can be confirmed\nPayment dispute holds\nPayment dispute holds are when we place a hold on funds related to a problem reported by a buyer, regardless of whether the transaction is covered by our eBay Money Back Guarantee or not.\nFor example, if a buyer reports that an item hasn't arrived, or the item they received is significantly different from the listing description, we hold funds until the case is resolved and closed. For more information see our article on best practices for avoiding and handling issues with buyers .\nThe funds on hold may be used to refund the buyer for the same transaction.\nPayout holds\nPayout holds are when we hold funds payable to a particular seller, and usually require further seller action on the account.\nRegistration holds: We may hold payouts if we identify a discrepancy with the information you provided at registration. If your account is restricted, we'll notify you by email with a request for additional information. For more information on how to verify your identity, see our article on registering as a seller\nCompliance holds: eBay maintains policies and procedures to protect buyers and sellers while complying with applicable laws - opens in new window or tab . If your account has a payout hold or restriction for compliance reasons, we'll notify you by email and may request additional information from you\nPerformance holds: We hold your payouts if we identify unusual activity associated with your account, such as increased customer claims, a sudden change in your selling activity, late deliveries, or negative buyer feedback\nInvalid payment method: We may put your payouts on hold if we can't deduct your selling fees and other costs from any of your on-file payment methods. In this case, you’ll need to add another payment method\nTax information: We may put your payouts on hold if we can’t validate your Form W-9 for tax returns"

In this situation, the total amount of the sale is determined as follows:\nAuction-style listing format: The total amount of the sale is the auction start price, the Buy It Now price (if applicable), the reserve price (if applicable), or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is highest.\nFixed price listing format: The total amount of the sale is the fixed price or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is higher.\nSellers not meeting performance expectations\nAdditional final value fees may apply on sales in the following circumstances:\nIf your account doesn't meet our minimum seller performance standards for the US in the evaluation on the 20th of the month, you'll be charged an additional 6% on the final value fees applicable to sales in the following calendar month. Go to your Seller Dashboard - opens in new window or tab to check your current seller level. This fee does not apply to Above Standard and eBay Top-rated Sellers\nIf your rate of 'Item not as described' return requests is evaluated in your service metrics as Very High in the evaluation on the 20th of the month in one or more categories, you will be charged an additional 5% on the final value fees for sales in those categories in the following calendar month. You can view your personalized service metrics on your Service Metrics dashboard - opens in new window or tab in Seller Hub.\nAny additional final value fees will be calculated as a percentage of the total amount of the sale. We'll indicate which listings are subject to additional fees on your Account Summary - opens in new window or tab .\nNote: If your account isn't meeting our minimum seller performance standards and you're rated Very High in your rate of 'Item not as described' return requests, you'll only be charged the additional final value fee for not meeting our minimum seller performance standards.\nDispute fee\nIf you are found responsible for a disputed amount as per eBay policies (e.g., chargeback), we charge a $20.00 dispute fee, excluding sales tax, for each dispute.\nInternational fee\nIf your registered address is in the US and you offer eBay International Shipping - opens in new window or tab for your eligible listings, you won't be charged an international fee when your eligible item sells.\nIf you're not using eBay International Shipping to ship your item, we charge an international fee if either:\nThe delivery address for the item (entered by the buyer during checkout) is outside the US, or\nThe buyer's registered address is outside the US (regardless of the delivery address for the item)\nThis fee is calculated as 1.65% of the total amount of the sale and is automatically deducted from your sales.\nIf your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country or region of residence for your international fee information.\nSeller currency conversion charge\nWhen you create listings or sell items on an international eBay site, eBay may convert your funds to a different currency in order to collect amounts owed by you to eBay, or to payout funds due to you.\nFor example, if your registered address is in the US and you create a listing on eBay.de for which fees are due (such as insertion and/or optional listing upgrade fees), eBay will convert your funds from USD to EUR using the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of listing, in order to collect these fees. When the item sells on eBay.de, eBay will calculate your payout amount by converting the sales proceeds from EUR to USD using the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the sale.\nIf eBay converts your funds, the conversion will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. eBay's transaction exchange rate is composed of a base exchange rate plus a conversion charge. The conversion charge is a fixed percentage applied to the base exchange rate and retained by eBay. The base exchange rate reflects rates within the wholesale currency markets applicable to the currency pairing on the day of the conversion, or the prior business day. If exchange rates are set by law or regulation, the base exchange rate reflects the government reference rates.\nIf your registered address is in the US, the seller currency conversion charge applied and retained by eBay is 3%. If your registered address is not in the US, please refer to the fee page for your country or region of residence for your seller currency conversion charge information.\nExamples of fee calculations\nAuction-style listing example\nYou're selling the latest version of a smartphone in used condition using a 10-day duration. You select a starting price of $199, with a Buy It Now price of $400, and you offer free shipping.\nYou've already used your allocation of zero insertion fee listings this month.

You can use the information on your Form 1099-K to help you comply with your tax obligations. \nHelp webpage content: IRS Form 1099-K reports payments made to you within a given calendar year. eBay has an obligation to issue Form 1099-K to sellers who meet specific criteria. This includes, among other criteria, sellers whose transactions on eBay meet the IRS and state minimum reporting thresholds or sellers whose transactions had any backup withholding applied. We'll provide you with Form 1099-K by January 31 each year if you've received payments that meet or exceed the reporting thresholds in the previous calendar year:\n*This figure is based on the IRS’s announcement - opens in new window or tab that they are planning for a $5,000 transitional threshold in 2024.\nIf eligible, you'll automatically receive a Form 1099-K in your eBay account. You can download an electronic copy in Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab and My eBay - opens in new window or tab . To receive a physical copy of your Form 1099-K as well, simply turn off Electronic delivery on your Taxes page. Your Form 1099-K will show payments received for sales on eBay. It will include the gross amount and number of transactions, your name, address, and Tax ID. Forms 1099-K will also be reported to the IRS and the correct state tax authority, where applicable.\nIf PayPal or another authorized payment service provider also processed any of your eBay payments during the previous calendar year, you should receive a separate form from them, if your transactions met the IRS reporting thresholds above.\nTip Ensure that the name on your eBay account matches the name on your Tax ID and Federal income tax return.\nIf you’re a limited liability company, you can read our Registering as a seller - opens in new window or tab article for details on updating your tax information.\nForm 1099-K and multiple eBay accounts\nIf you have multiple eBay accounts associated with the same Tax ID, your thresholds are calculated by combining all the payments and transactions of those accounts. If your total sales across all your eBay accounts are over the limits previously mentioned, you'll get a Form 1099-K for each account. This happens even if some accounts alone don't meet the IRS's minimum amounts for reporting.\nFor example, you may have two eBay seller accounts associated with the same Tax ID. For the tax year 2023, if you have over 200 sales transactions combined between the two accounts, and you received $19,999 in payments on one account and $5 on the other, you'll receive a separate Form 1099-K for each account. We can't split the form between multiple tax ID numbers for the same calendar year.\nWhat's included in Form 1099-K\nForm 1099-K is an IRS information return that includes the gross amount of all reportable payments within a calendar year. This is based on when gross funds are processed to eBay, not necessarily when funds are received by sellers. This amount does not include any adjustments, for example, credits, discounts, fees, refunds, or any other adjustable amounts. However, sales tax and canceled transactions are excluded from the gross amount reported. You should check with your tax advisor to decide how best to use the information on your Form 1099-K when filing your personal and/or business income tax return.\nYou can contact us with any questions about your Form 1099-K. Make sure to have the item number and transaction details ready. You should contact us with any concerns about your Form 1099-K no later than March 30th of any year. This will ensure eBay has time to review your claim and make any needed corrections by April 15th of the same year.\nTip We’ll issue your Form 1099-K with the information you’ve used to register your account, in accordance with IRS requirements.

To request a return, select Try to get my item returned and verify or edit your return address\nTo request a return, select Try to get my item returned and verify or edit your return address\nMake sure the information is correct, add supporting text, and/or upload new evidence.\nSelect Submit .\nProviding evidence for the payment dispute\nBecause different types of evidence can be more helpful in certain cases, we recommend providing different types of evidence depending on the type of payment dispute. We'll send all evidence to the buyer's payment institution.\nBuyer doesn’t recognise the transaction or Buyer didn't receive the item\nTracking information showing the order was delivered successfully to the shipping address that matches the address on the order details page\nSignature confirmation when an order total is greater than or equal to $750\nLearn more about signature confirmation requirements .\nValid buyer identification for an in-store pickup and proof of pickup which includes:\nDate of pickup\nStore of delivery (applicable for in-store pickup), matching the shipping address on the order\nOrder ID, item number, item title, and price paid\nThe customer's signature on the pickup form or packing slip\nA copy of the eBay order details, signed by the buyer at the time of collection, or\nThe seller used the eBay app to scan the buyer's QR code or manually entered the buyer's 6-digit pickup code at the time of collection\nProof of delivery, or\nShipping confirmation (bill of lading, shipping receipt) - when the vehicle is still in transit\nA receipt with item details, signed by the buyer\nItem doesn't match the listing or Item was damaged when received or Item received had missing parts\nA clear photo showing the item is as described and its condition pre-shipping\nMessages with the buyer showing the issue has been solved, e.g. a partial refund or seller solution was accepted\nAny other evidence that proves the item was returned in a different condition\nItem wasn't authentic\nProof of authenticity from the rights owner\nMessages with the buyer showing attempt to resolve issues prior to dispute\nBuyer didn't receive a refund\nProof that a refund was already provided on eBay\nProof of cancellation\nYour stated return policy\nMessages with the buyer showing that a refund isn’t required\nProof that the item was returned in a different condition, or that a different item was returned\nBefore you upload an image, it helps to crop the image to the relevant area. You can also compress or merge images if you wish. Your image can be in JPEG, JPG, or PNG format. The maximum number of files allowed is five, and the total size for all files should be under 1.75 MB. You can also provide supporting text when challenging the dispute.\nWhen you challenge the payment dispute, the final outcome will be decided by the buyer’s payment institution. The payment dispute could take up to 90 days or more to be resolved, depending on the payment method or card provider. eBay may hold the funds from payout up to 90 days from when the dispute arises.\nIf the dispute is found in your favor, you won't be charged for a refund and you won’t have to pay a dispute fee .\nIf the dispute is found in the buyer's favor, they’ll receive a refund. Whether you're charged for the refund and whether you have to pay a dispute fee depends on whether you're eligible for our payment dispute seller protections . You won't be charged more than one dispute fee per order, even if your buyer has used multiple forms of payment.\nIf you’re not eligible for seller protections, the refund amount will generally be deducted from the total of your Available, Processing, and On hold funds, and you’ll be charged a dispute fee. If you are eligible for seller protections, you won’t be charged the refund amount and we may also waive or refund the dispute fee.\nTip If you ask for an item to be returned to you during a payment dispute, we’ll try to recover the item for you, regardless of whether you accept or challenge the payment dispute. However, we can’t guarantee the buyer will return the item.\nChecking the status of a payment dispute\nOnce you've responded to a payment dispute, we'll email you with any updates about the status of the dispute. You can also check the status of the dispute at any time by finding the order in My eBay Orders - opens in new window or tab or Requests and disputes - opens in new window or tab in Seller Hub.\nIn some cases, your buyer's payment institution may reopen a closed payment dispute. If this happens, you may be asked to provide additional evidence for challenging the dispute.\nAvoiding payment disputes\nA buyer may open a dispute if:\nThey didn't receive their item\nThe item doesn't match the description in your listing\nThey didn't recognise the transaction\nThey were charged more than once for an item or for the transaction\nThey changed their mind or canceled the transaction\nThey’re missing a credit or a refund\nTo help prevent payment disputes, you should always:\nCreate detailed, accurate listings\nInclude multiple, high-quality photos of your items\nUse a tracked shipping service with proof of delivery to the address provided by the buyer at checkout\nInclude signature confirmation if an order has a total cost (including shipping and taxes) of $750 or more. Learn more about signature confirmation requirements\nBe responsive to buyers who contact you through eBay Messages and work to resolve any issues\nKeep any messages and supporting documentation through eBay tools\nWhen deducting an amount from the buyer's refund, provide information to your buyer as to why you didn’t issue a full refund. For example, \"deducted 5% from the refund because the item was returned used or damaged\"\nBuyers can't use more than one resolution method to get a refund. If a buyer opens a dispute, any open order cancellations, reports that an item hasn't arrived, return requests, or eBay Money Back Guarantee cases for the same transaction are immediately closed."

Sellers with access to Seller Hub can use Product research . \nHelp webpage content: Business sellers with a Basic Store subscription or above also get access to Sourcing insights as part of their Store subscription.\nProduct research\nWith Product research, you can see how products and categories are performing across all of eBay's marketplaces. Easy-to-understand reports provide an overview of which products and categories are popular, and which strategies are successful in attracting buyers.\nFor customized and targeted insights about markets you're interested in, simply search by keyword or product, and apply filters such as Category, item Condition, or other filters such as Brand, Color, or Buyer and Seller locations.\nGo to Product research\nProduct research gives you access to the last 3 years of eBay sales data for millions of items, including:\nSales trends\nAverage sales price\nSold price range\nAverage shipping costs and the number of listings offering free shipping\nSell through rate (for searches of items sold 90 days ago or less)\nTotal number of sellers who have sold that item\nThe selling format in which items are sold\nSourcing insights\nWith Sourcing insights, sellers can access real-world sales data to develop their sourcing strategy and identify areas of opportunity. Sourcing insights is available at no extra cost to business sellers with a Basic Store subscription or above. If you don’t yet have a Store but would like to use Sourcing insights, you can sign up for a Store today.\nSourcing insights also helps sellers to:\nSource inventory based off of sold single stock listings to discover what is in or out of stock so that you can offer a competitive option\nResearch by Category to gain insights into categories which have high demand and low inventory represented on eBay\nGo to Sourcing insights\nFrequently Asked Questions\nProduct research results differ from eBay completed listings search results in several important ways.\nLonger time periods: Product research enables users to search time periods of any length, across the last 3 years. eBay completed listings results include only listings that have recently ended sold in the previous 90 days.\nMore complete data: Prodcut research search results include item sales with the actual price that the item sold for, even if a Best Offer was accepted.\nCalculated metrics: Product research calculates a broad range of metrics for the results of any search, including average sold prices, average shipping costs and terms, number of sellers who sold that item, sell-through rates, upward or downward trends, and more.\nSearch specificity: Product research results are intended to be highly specific to the searches that you construct; in general, a listing or sale must exactly match your search keywords and parameters to be included in results. eBay search results often include other \"related\" results, particularly if the search that you enter matches few or zero listings or sales.\nThere are several ways to refine your Product research search results:\nSelect a date range: Filter your results by specific date ranges - anywhere from one day to 3 years in duration\nApply search filters: Filter results by certain MPN, UPC, EPID, EAN or ISBN codes, sale price ranges, listing formats, item conditions, buyer locations, seller locations or eBay marketplaces\nSearch by category: Filter results by transactions that occurred in a particular eBay category. To apply filters that are more specific to a particular category of items, select a category from all available sub category dropdowns (For example, eBay.com > Cell Phones & Accessories > Cell Phones & Smartphones .) Then select Apply to see dynamic filters such as Condition, Model, Color etc.\nUse advanced search logic or exclusions: If you search for multiple words, for example \"iPhone XS Max 64GB\", you'll see listings with all of these keywords (iPhone + XS + Max + 64GB) in the title. You can exclude results by adding \"AND NOT\" or \"-\" in front of a keyword. For example: \"iPhone XS Max 64GB -cover\" will exclude listings that have \"cover\" in the title If you add \"OR\" between keywords, for example: iPhone XS MAX AND (64GB OR 256GB), this will show iPhone XS MAX listings with either 64GB OR 256GB in the title\nIf you search for multiple words, for example \"iPhone XS Max 64GB\", you'll see listings with all of these keywords (iPhone + XS + Max + 64GB) in the title.\nYou can exclude results by adding \"AND NOT\" or \"-\" in front of a keyword. For example: \"iPhone XS Max 64GB -cover\" will exclude listings that have \"cover\" in the title\nIf you add \"OR\" between keywords, for example: iPhone XS MAX AND (64GB OR 256GB), this will show iPhone XS MAX listings with either 64GB OR 256GB in the title\nThis can mean the actual listing was removed or made unavailable, either by eBay or the seller. Listings which were sold in the previous 90 days or are active, are accessible by clicking on the title or from View item in the eBay app.\nYes, with Multi-User Account Access (MUAA), you can delegate access to your account so that other members can perform certain functions on your behalf. This allows you to scale your business without exposing your password and other personal details associated with the account.\nTo find out more about delegating and managing access to your account see our MUAA FAQs - opens in new window or tab .\nTip To give us feedback on Product research, select Comments? from the right hand corner of your Research dashboard - opens in new window or tab ."

There are also some simple steps you can take to make your account more secure. \nHelp webpage content: Here are some things you can do to help protect your eBay account and keep your personal data safe.\nChange your password regularly\nTo keep your account secure, we recommend regularly updating your password. Choose a strong password that’s difficult for others to guess.\nFollow these tips for creating a strong new password:\nAvoid using personal details such as your name, birth date, or user ID\nConsider using a phrase (for example, a song lyric or book title)\nUse numbers and special characters\nDon’t use the same password that you use on other accounts\nIf you think your eBay account was compromised or hacked, you should change the passwords for both your eBay account and personal email account. Your email password should be different from your eBay password.\nTo find out more, read our article on changing your password .\nPasskeys\nPasskeys are an alternative to passwords that allow you to sign into your eBay account using biometric authentication such as a fingerprint, pattern, or PIN.This means you don’t need to enter your password, and it will help protect your eBay account against unauthorized access.\nYou can set up passkeys from the prompt after you sign in or from the Sign in and Security settings in your eBay account. You can also disable the passkey option in your Sign in and Security settings.\nIf your passkey fails, you'll receive an error message and be prompted to log in using your username and password.\nAdd 2 step verification\nTo add an extra layer of security to your eBay account, we strongly recommend you enable 2 step verification. Once you’ve enabled 2 step verification, only you can access your account, even if someone else has obtained your password.\nOnce you’ve  switched on 2 step verification, each time you sign in to your account you’ll be able to confirm your identity via an eBay app push notification by entering a code we send you via SMS, or one-time passcode generated by an authenticator app.\nHere’s how to set up 2 step verification on the eBay app:\nDownload the latest version of the eBay app.\nSign in to your account.\nGo to My eBay and tap Settings .\nGo to Sign in and security and then choose 2 Step Verification .\nTap Turn on beside Use the eBay app.\nHere’s how to set up 2 step verification by SMS:\nSign in to your eBay account.\nGo to your name in the top left-hand corner and choose Account settings from the dropdown menu.\nSelect Sign in and security .\nSelect Edit next to 2 Step Verification.\nSelect Use text next to Text messages on mobile .\nFollow the on-screen prompts to add your mobile number.\nHere's how to set up 2 Step Verification using an authenticator app:\nSign in to your eBay account.\nGo to your name in the top left-hand corner and choose Account settings from the dropdown menu.\nSelect Sign in and security .\nSelect Edit next to 2 Step Verification.\nSelect Authenticator App.\nInstall the authenticator app from your phone’s app store. We recommend Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy.\nScan the QR code to add eBay to your authenticator app.\nConfirm the 6-digit code generated by your authenticator app on eBay.\nIf you change your mind and want to switch 2 step verification off—or you’d like to change from SMS to app notifications or authenticator app—simply follow the steps above to turn off the function. We’ll also send you an email to let you know when you’ve switched 2 step verification on or off.\nReceiving invalid code error\nEnsure you leave your browser window open until the email code is received. Don’t leave the sign in page, close, or click back on the browser, otherwise the old code will be revoked and you will receive the error message.\nGeneral troubleshooting for SMS and email issues\n15-minute code delivery window – Make sure to enter the code with the 15-minute window. The code is invalid after 15 minutes. Be sure to check your spam folder if you’re not seeing it in your inbox\nSMS/Text message – Make sure you can receive SMS/Text messages and that you have proper reception before sending the code. Landlines are not supported\nAre you using multiple SIM cards – Make sure that the SIM settings are set to either SIM1 or SIM2, depending on which one the proper number is\nNetwork type of the mobile phone – Make sure you have the proper network type selected in the settings.

Next time you sign in using the trusted device, you may not be prompted for a 2 step verification, but your account will still be secure.\nKeep in mind that if you change your 2 step verification method or remove a trusted device, you’ll need to follow the steps to add the trusted device again. You can add up to 100 trusted devices to your eBay account. You can check your trusted devices at any time by visiting the Security Center.\nUpdate your contact details\nIt’s important to keep your contact information up to date so we can reach you with updates about your account.\nIf you change your address or phone number, or set up a new email address, please update your contact details as soon as possible so your account information remains correct.\nRead our article on changing your contact details for more information.\nWatch out for spoof or phishing emails\nSpoof or phishing emails are emails that claim to be from eBay and are sent with the intent of accessing your passwords and other sensitive information. If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from eBay, you should immediately forward the message to us at spoof@ebay.com . Don’t click any links in the email or open any attachments. We’ll let you know that we received your email, and we will investigate.\nFind out how to spot suspicious emails in our article on recognizing spoof emails .\nReport any strange activity on your account\nIt’s a good idea to check My eBay - opens in new window or tab and your preferences - opens in new window or tab regularly to make sure no one has accessed your account or made changes without your permission.

If you don’t have enough funds to cover the cost of the refund, the amount will be paid from your linked checking account or an on-file payment method.\nFor example, if you issue your buyer a $100 refund and only have $80 in Available and Processing funds, your payout checking account or on-file payment method will be used to fund the remaining $20\nWhen eBay refunds your buyer in an eBay Money Back Guarantee case\nWhen eBay issues a refund to your buyer on your behalf due to an eBay Money Back Guarantee case, the amount will be automatically deducted from the total of your Available or Processing funds. This may impact your protections as a seller .\nWhen eBay refunds a buyer in a return request\neBay may sometimes issue a refund to your buyer on confirmation the return is on its way. When this happens, we’ll wait until the item is back with you before deducting the amount from you. This doesn’t impact your protections as a seller .\nOnce you've inspected the item, you can complete the refund process from the return details and close the return\nIf you don’t send the refund in the time frame provided in the return details, we’ll automatically deduct the amount from the total of your Available or Processing funds\nWhen a buyer is refunded in a payment dispute\nWhen a buyer’s financial institution determines they are due a refund, we may deduct the amount from the total of your Available or Processing funds. If the buyer is owed a refund and you’re eligible for payment dispute seller protections , no funds will be deducted from your account.\nIf funds are insufficient\nIf the total of your Available or Processing funds are insufficient to cover the outstanding amounts you owe, eBay will charge your on-file payment method for the remaining amounts owed within 14 days. We may add up the amounts you owe into a single charge. All the details related to these charges will be visible on your Financial statement.\nTip You can choose a preferred on-file payment method - opens in new window or tab to cover the refund amounts if your funds are insufficient. Make sure your payment method is up to date to avoid any charge failure.\nIssuing a refund\nYou can issue full or partial refunds for items in Seller Hub or My eBay up to 90 days after the original transaction. Here's how:\nFind the order in Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab or My eBay Orders - opens in new window or tab .\nFrom the dropdown menu, select Send refund.\nChoose a reason for the refund.\nSpecify a refund amount for the item or for the order.\nEnter the refund amount, and select Send refund.\nYou'll get an email confirming that the refund has been initiated, and another email once the refund is complete. The refunded amount will appear in your order details. You can refund up to 100% of the transaction.\nIf you're issuing a partial refund for an order, the amount will be split proportionally across each item in the order.\nYou may be eligible for fee credits - opens in new window or tab if you refund the buyer on eBay without us stepping in.\nIf there's an open cancellation request, return request, eBay Money Back Guarantee case, a report that an item hasn't arrived, or an open dispute made outside of eBay against an order, then the Send refund option will not be available. Instead, any refunds must be made through the open request or case, which can be viewed in My eBay Orders - opens in new window or tab , or the Returns, Cancellations, or Requests and disputes tabs in Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab .\nIf there’s an issue with the refund, you’ll be prompted to use the Retry refund button. If you’re still not able to issue a refund, you can change how the refund is funded. We do not recommend issuing a refund outside of eBay, as this will not qualify for seller protections.\nIf you're still having trouble issuing a refund, try the following:\nMake sure you have sufficient funds. If there aren't enough funds available, you can change your on-file payment method and then try to issue the refund again\nCheck that all your payment method details, such as card number, expiration date, and CVV code are entered correctly. Make sure the name and billing addresses are exactly as they appear on your card statement. See our article on how to update your payment method\nActivate your on-file payment method. If you're using a new card for the first time, you may need to contact your card issuer to activate the card\nUpdate your web browser. Older browsers may not be secure enough for processing a refund. See our article on technical issues for more information on keeping your browser up to date\nTip Sales on all items in the eBay vault that have passed our Authenticity Guarantee inspection are final, which means they’re not eligible for a refund. Learn more about the eBay vault .\nChanging how your refunds are funded\nFind the order by going to Orders in Seller Hub - opens in new window or tab or My eBay - opens in new window or tab .\nSelect Send Refund , or view the Cancellation , Return , or Item Not Received request.\nSelect Change next to the payment method you want to update.\nSelect your preferred payment method or add a new option and select Save .\nThe saved payment method will be used for any future charges. If your preferred payment method is unsuccessful, we will recoup the amount from your other on-file payment method."

When the item sells on eBay.de, eBay will calculate your payout amount by converting the sales proceeds from EUR to USD using the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the sale.\nIf eBay converts your funds, the conversion will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. eBay's transaction exchange rate is composed of a base exchange rate plus a conversion charge. The conversion charge is a fixed percentage applied to the base exchange rate and retained by eBay. The base exchange rate reflects rates within the wholesale currency markets applicable to the currency pairing on the day of the conversion, or the prior business day. If exchange rates are set by law or regulation, the base exchange rate reflects the government reference rates.\nSee the table below for details of the seller currency conversion charge applied and retained by eBay:\nMalaysia, Israel\n2.5%\nLatin America*\n3.5%\nAll other eBay global countries\n3.0%\n*Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Montserrat, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Uruguay, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\nIf your registered address is not in an eBay global country, please refer to the fee page for your country/region of residence for your seller currency conversion charge information.\nOverseas territories\nIf your registered address is in any of the following overseas territories, then we treat you as if you are domiciled in the associated country for the purpose of calculating your fees.\nFor example, if your registered address is in Puerto Rico and you sell and ship an item to a buyer in the United States, then you will not be charged an International fee for that transaction.\nPlease refer to the table for information about which fees page applies to you.\nFrench Guiana French Polynesia* Guadeloupe Martinique Mayotte* New Caledonia* Réunion* Saint Pierre and Miquelon*\nFrance - opens in new window or tab\nAnguilla* Bermuda* Cayman Islands* Falkland Islands (Malvinas)* Gibraltar Guernsey Jersey Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha* Virgin Islands (British)*\nUnited Kingdom - opens in new window or tab\nAmerican Samoa Guam Puerto Rico Virgin Islands (US)\nUnited States\n*Payouts are in USD for sellers with a registered address in these territories.\nLinks to our fees pages on international sites: United States | United Kingdom | Canada | Germany | France | Italy | Spain | Australia | Austria | Switzerland | Ireland | Belgium (Dutch) | Belgium (French) | Netherlands | Poland | Greater China region | Hong Kong | Singapore | Malaysia | Philippines"

Most larger brands of CE-marked products have an economic operator already established in the EU. ​The economic operator can be a manufacturer, importer, authorized representative or fulfillment service provider based in the EU. If the products you ship to the EU don’t contain this information, your goods may be stopped at customs and/or be prevented from being delivered to your buyer.\nTo ensure you're compliant with the regulations, follow these steps:\nCheck if you are selling CE-marked products into Europe. You can see examples of products that carry the CE symbol in our FAQ .\nVerify the products are meant for the EU market and comply with the EU legislation. If in doubt, contact the manufacturer.\nIf the products are compliant, check whether you see information of the EU manufacturer or EU importer on the products. If there is an EU manufacturer or importer, they are the economic operator in Europe.\nIf there is no EU manufacturer or importer, check with the non-EU manufacturer to see if they have an authorized representative. If there is one, obtain the name and contact details (including shipping address) of the authorized representative and ensure that the information is indicated on the product or its packaging. If the non-EU manufacturer has not appointed an authorized representative in the EU, work with the manufacturer to appoint one.

Their key tasks include:\nVerifying that the declaration of conformity / performance for a product has been drawn up and kept pursuant to legal requirements\nVerifying that the technical documentation of the product has been drawn up and provided to the market surveillance authorities on request\nCooperating with relevant authorities to provide any other information to demonstrate product conformity as required Where an economic operator has reason to believe that a product is not compliant or poses a health and safety risk to the public, it has to inform the authorities and take corrective action, whether by itself or by asking the manufacturer to do so\nWhere an economic operator has reason to believe that a product is not compliant or poses a health and safety risk to the public, it has to inform the authorities and take corrective action, whether by itself or by asking the manufacturer to do so\nThey apply to a wide range of products which are required to bear CE marking.  Examples include:\nconstruction products\npersonal protective equipment\nappliances burning gaseous fuels\nproducts subject to the Directive relating to noise emissions by equipment for use outdoors\nmachinery\ntoys\nproducts subject to ecodesign requirements\nproducts subject to restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment\npyrotechnic articles\nrecreational craft and personal watercraft\nsimple pressure vessels\nproducts subject to the Directive on electromagnetic compatibility\nnon-automatic weighing instruments\nmeasuring instruments\nequipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres\nproducts subject to the Low Voltage Directive\nradio equipment\npressure equipment\nProducts requiring CE marking are covered by the EU New Approach Directive.  The UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is a new UK product marking that is used for goods being placed on the market in Great Britain.

If the fulfillment service provider accepts the documents and your goods, it will become an economic operator and you can then indicate their name or contact information (including shipping address) on the product or its packaging. However, some fulfillment service providers may ask for an authorized representative of your products instead. In which case, you would still need to work with the non-EU manufacturer to appoint an authorized representative in the EU.\nYou can work with manufacturers or the brand owner of the products you are selling to see if they have an authorized representative in the EU. You can also research options online as there are quite a number of companies offering authorized representative services in the EU.\nIn addition, we have identified some experienced third-party companies who may be able to assist.

The test report must contain all the details necessary to demonstrate the product conforms to the applicable requirements and supports a declaration of conformity\nWe will temporarily hide listings if the correct documents haven’t been uploaded within the set timeframe.\nPlease submit an appeal so we can create a new upload option for you. Please do not relist your item until we have verified the documents are compliant.\nThese are common reasons for insufficient documentation that we have seen in the past:\nIncorrect documents are provided. Instead of declaration of conformity, we have seen sellers submit certificate of conformity\nDeclaration of conformity missed critical information such as signature, date, EU directive, business address, harmonized standards or type approval"

This is different to our eBay Money Back Guarantee , when your buyer reports an issue with their order on eBay. The disputed amount may be placed on hold until the issue is resolved. This is different to a hold being placed on your payouts, when you may need to take further action on your eBay account to resolve the issue.\nWhen your buyer opens a payment dispute, we’ll contact you to let you know what the next steps are. To respond, you'll need to either accept or challenge the payment dispute within 5 calendar days - if you don’t respond, the payment institution is likely to find in your buyer's favour. You can respond through My eBay Orders or Requests and disputes in Seller Hub. The final outcome will be decided by the buyer’s payment institution.\nResponding to a payment dispute\nWhen responding to a dispute, you may choose to:\nAccept the dispute, or\nChallenge the dispute\nAccepting the payment dispute\nIf you agree with the buyer, or you’d prefer not to challenge the payment dispute, you can accept the dispute.

If you don’t have enough funds to cover the cost of the refund, the amount will be paid from your on-file payment method. We’ll close the payment dispute once the buyer's payment institution confirms the refund. We’ll also waive the dispute fee where applicable, and you'll receive fee credits for some or all of your fees for the disputed transaction.\nTip In some cases, eBay may respond to a payment dispute on your behalf, even if you accept the dispute. If you accept the dispute and eBay challenges the dispute on your behalf, you won't be charged a dispute fee, regardless of the listing site.\nChallenging the payment dispute\nIf you don't agree with the buyer, you can challenge the payment dispute and provide some supporting evidence to help resolve the issue. Here’s how:\nSelect Respond to dispute from My eBay Orders or Requests and disputes or tab in Seller Hub.\nSelect Challenge dispute and provide proof and select Continue .

The maximum number of files allowed is five, and the total size for all files should be under 1.5 MB.\nWhen you challenge the payment dispute, the final outcome will be decided by the buyer’s payment institution. The payment dispute could take up to 90 days or more to be resolved, depending on the payment method or card provider. eBay may hold the funds from payout up to 30 days from when the dispute arises.\nIf the dispute is found in your favour, you won't be charged for a refund and you won’t have to pay a dispute fee, regardless of the listing site.\nIf the dispute is found in the buyer's favour, they’ll receive a refund. Whether you're charged for the refund and whether you have to pay a dispute fee depends on whether you're eligible for our payment dispute seller protections and the listing site.\nIf you’re not eligible for seller protections, the refund amount will generally be deducted from the total of your Available, Processing, and On hold funds, and you’ll be charged a dispute fee where applicable. If you are eligible for seller protections, you won’t be charged the refund amount and we may also waive or refund the dispute fee where applicable.\nTip Dispute fees do not apply to items listed on sites within the EU, but may apply to items listed on sites outside the EU. The dispute fee will be waived if you accept the dispute, if the dispute is found in your favour, or if eBay challenges the dispute on your behalf. If you're eligible for seller protections, eBay may also waive or refund the dispute fee.\nDispute fees\nIf a buyer files a payment dispute, and you’re found responsible for the disputed amount, you may be charged a dispute fee by eBay. If you accept the payment dispute and issue a refund, eBay will waive the dispute fee, and you’ll be responsible for the refund amount issued to your buyer.\nThe amount of the dispute fee depends on which eBay site the listing was created on. Below, you'll find the links to our fees pages for the eBay sites where we charge a dispute fee:\nUnited States\nUnited Kingdom\nCanada\nAustralia\nTip If you ask for an item to be returned to you during a payment dispute, we’ll try to recover the item for you, regardless of whether you accept or challenge the payment dispute. However, we can’t guarantee the buyer will return the item.\nChecking the status of a payment dispute\nOnce you've responded to a payment dispute, we'll email you with any updates about the status of the dispute. You can also check the status of the dispute at any time by finding the order in My eBay Orders or Requests and disputes in Seller Hub.\nIn some cases, your buyer's payment institution may reopen a closed payment dispute. If this happens, you may be asked to provide additional evidence for challenging the dispute.\nAvoiding payment disputes\nA buyer may open a dispute if:\nThey didn't receive their item\nThe item doesn't match the description in your listing\nThey didn't recognise the transaction\nThey were charged more than once for an item or for the transaction\nThey changed their mind or cancelled the transaction\nThey’re missing a credit or a refund\nTo help prevent payment disputes, you should always:\nCreate detailed, accurate listings\nInclude multiple, high-quality photos of your items\nUse a tracked shipping service with proof of delivery to the address provided by the buyer at checkout\nInclude signature confirmation for items that cost over a certain amount. Learn more about signature confirmation requirements\nBe responsive to buyers who contact you through eBay Messages and work to resolve any issues\nKeep any messages and supporting documentation through eBay tools\nWhen deducting an amount from the buyer's refund, provide information to your buyer as to why you didn’t issue a full refund. For example, \"as agreed, deducted 5% from the refund instead of returning the item''\nBuyers can't use more than one resolution method to get a refund. If a buyer opens a dispute, any open order cancellations, reports that an item hasn't arrived, return requests, or eBay Money Back Guarantee cases for the same transaction are immediately closed."

        "content": "Help webpage title: Payments on hold \nHelp webpage description: We know it's important that you receive your money as quickly as possible. However, we may sometimes need to put a hold on your funds due to your selling history or performance or to address disputes. This helps us keep eBay a safe marketplace for buyers and sellers. \nHelp webpage content: You can check on the status of a payment by going to the Payments tab in Seller Hub.\nWhy we put payments on hold and how to avoid it\nIn most cases, holds are lifted when a buyer confirms they've received their item or when a case is resolved.\nTo help ensure eBay remains a safe place to buy and sell, and to meet our legal and compliance obligations , we sometimes place a hold on funds, for example, if there's an open case or dispute on a transaction, if your buyer reports a problem with the order, if your account is restricted or suspended, if you owe eBay money or if you're a new or infrequent seller. If we placed a hold on your funds, we'll notify you by email and depending on the reason, may request additional information from you to help resolve the issue.\nTypes of holds\nThere are various reasons why we may place a hold on your funds.\nTransaction holds\nTransaction holds are when we place a hold on funds related to a particular buyer transaction. The funds on hold may be used to refund the buyer for the same transaction.\nWhile proceeds from your sales typically become available within 2 days of confirming the buyer’s payment, we may place a transaction hold on funds while we ensure a successful transaction. To reduce the likelihood of a transaction hold, we recommend shipping an item the same day your buyer pays for it and following good shipping practices, such as adding tracking information to your order.\nTip If we place a hold on your funds, it will usually be resolved within 30 days, but in rare circumstances it may take longer. For most orders, adding tracking information can help you receive your funds faster.\nAdditionally, we may place a transaction hold on funds depending on your seller status, changes to your account status, or other factors we use to help ensure a safe marketplace in all categories, regardless of whether the transaction is covered by our eBay Money Back Guarantee or not:\nNew or infrequent sellers will experience transaction holds while learning best selling practices. This helps sellers become established and build a strong selling history on eBay. New sellers typically experience holds for up to 14 days, although sometimes it may be longer\nPreviously restricted or suspended sellers will experience transaction holds for the 30 days after the restriction or suspension is lifted, while we confirm that the items have been successfully delivered\nHigh priced items or unusual selling patterns may lead to transaction holds for up to 30 days to help us ensure that buyers don't have any issues with the order\nThe authentication process may lead to transaction holds for up to 30 days until the authenticity of items sold with eBay's Authenticity Guarantee can be confirmed\nPayment dispute holds\nPayment dispute holds are when we place a hold on funds related to a problem reported by a buyer, regardless of whether the transaction is covered by our eBay Money Back Guarantee or not.\nFor example, if a buyer reports that an item hasn't arrived, or the item they received is significantly different from the listing description, we hold funds until the case is resolved and closed. For more information see our article on best practices for avoiding and handling issues with buyers .\nThe funds on hold may be used to refund the buyer for the same transaction.\nPayout holds\nPayout holds are when we hold funds payable to a particular seller, and usually require further seller action on the account.\nRegistration holds : We may hold payouts if we identify a discrepancy with the information you provided at registration. If your account is restricted, we'll notify you by email with a request for additional information. For more information on how to verify your identity, see our article on registering as a seller\nCompliance holds : eBay maintains policies and procedures to protect buyers and sellers while complying with applicable laws . If your account has a payout hold or restriction for compliance reasons, we'll notify you by email and may request additional information from you\nPerformance holds : We hold your payouts if we identify unusual activity associated with your account, such as increased customer claims, a sudden change in your selling activity, late deliveries, or negative buyer feedback\nInvalid payment method : We may put your payouts on hold if we can't deduct your selling fees and other costs from any of your on-file payment methods. In this case, you'll need to add another payment method"

        "content": "Help webpage title: Refunding buyers \nHelp webpage description: Refunding your buyer as a seller is simple. Refunds can be issued by you, or by eBay. \nHelp webpage content: Depending on the situation, there are a number of ways a refund can be issued. As a seller, you can issue refunds through Seller Hub or My eBay. Sellers can also issue a refund through a cancellation or return request, or a report that an item hasn't arrived.\nAdditionally, eBay can issue a refund to your buyer as the result of an eBay Money Back Guarantee case or payment dispute. When eBay issues a refund to a buyer, we may deduct the full amount from the seller for reimbursement.\nHow refunds work\nWhen you offer your buyer a refund , the amount will be paid from the total of your Available, Processing, and On hold funds. If you don't have enough funds to cover the cost of the refund, the amount will be paid from your on-file payment method.\nFor example, if you issue your buyer a $100 refund and only have $80 in Available, Processing, and On hold funds, your on-file payment method will be used to fund the remaining $20\nWhen eBay issues a refund to your buyer on your behalf due to an eBay Money Back Guarantee case or payment dispute, the amount will be deducted from the total of your Available, Processing, and On hold funds.\nIf the total of your Available, Processing, and On hold funds are insufficient to cover the outstanding amounts you owe, eBay will charge your on-file payment method for the remaining amounts owed within 14 days. We may add up the amounts you owe into a single charge. All the details related to these charges will be visible on your Financial statement.\nTip You can choose a preferred on-file payment method to cover the refund amounts if your funds are insufficient. Please ensure your payment method is up to date to avoid any charge failure.\nIssuing a refund\nYou can issue full or partial refunds for items in Seller Hub up to 90 days after the original transaction. Here's how:\nLocate the order in Seller Hub or My eBay Orders.\nFrom the dropdown menu, select Send refund.\nChoose a reason for the refund.\nSpecify a refund amount for the item or for the order.\nEnter the desired refund amount, and select Send refund.\nYou'll get an email confirming that the refund has been initiated, and another email once the refund is complete. The refunded amount will appear in your order details. You can refund up to 100% of the transaction.\nIf you're issuing a partial refund for an order, the amount will be split proportionally across each item in the order.\nIf your buyer paid in a different currency than your payout currency, the payment will be converted to your payout currency. The currency exchange rate will be captured at the time of sale and can be viewed in the order details. This exchange rate will apply in the event of a refund. Buyers will always receive their refunds in the same currency they originally paid.\nIf there's an open cancellation request, return request, eBay Money Back Guarantee case, a report that an item hasn’t arrived, or an open dispute made outside of eBay against an order, then the Send refund option will not be available. Instead, any refunds must be made through the open request or case, which can be viewed in My eBay Orders, or the Returns, Cancellations, or Requests and disputes tabs in Seller Hub.\nIf there’s an issue with the refund, you’ll be prompted to use the Retry refund button. If you’re still not able to issue a refund, you can change how your refunds are funded. We do not recommend issuing a refund outside of eBay, as this will not qualify for seller protections.\nChanging how your refunds are funded\nTo select your preferred refund method if you don’t have enough Available, Processing, and On hold funds, follow the steps below:\nLocate the order by going to Orders in Seller Hub or My eBay.\nSelect Send Refund , or view the Cancellation , Return , or Item Not Received request.\nSelect Change how you’re charged .\nSelect your preferred payment method and select Save .\nThe saved payment method will be used for any future charges. If your preferred payment method is unsuccessful, we'll recoup the amount from your other on-file payment method."

Learn more about what we offer on our eBay Advertising overview page\nYou can promote your listings from the Advertising tab in Seller Hub. After creating a new campaign for promoting your listings, you’ll choose a campaign strategy.\nA campaign strategy determines how your listing will be promoted and how you'll be charged. When you promote your listings, there are two campaign strategies to choose from to fit your unique business needs:\nPriority campaign strategy\nGeneral campaign strategy\nPriority campaign strategy The priority strategy helps your listings reach highly motivated buyers through priority access to ad placements and advanced targeting controls. Only pay for clicks on your ads through the priority campaign strategy so you can drive more sales.\nGeneral campaign strategy The general strategy can increase the visibility and awareness of your listings with general access to ad placements so you can reach more buyers. You’ll only pay when your item sells through a click on your ad.\nPromoted Listings FAQs\nA campaign strategy determines how your listing will be promoted and how you'll be charged. The two campaign strategies available are the priority strategy and the general strategy.\nThe priority strategy helps you reach highly motivated buyers with priority access to ad placements and advanced controls - like keyword targeting - to help you drive sales.\nWhen you promote your listings using a priority strategy, your campaign will use a cost-per-click (CPC) model. You’ll only pay for clicks on your ads and the cost for each click is based on a second price auction, which means the fee charged will be determined by factors like listing quality, keyword relevance, your bid amount, competition from other sellers, and a reserve price (the minimum amount we've determined a click is worth, taking item quality, competition, seasonality, and marketplace thresholds into consideration).\nThe general strategy provides you with increased visibility of your listings with general access to ad placements with standard controls to help you reach more buyers.\nWhen you promote your listings using a general strategy, you only pay when your item sells. The amount you pay is determined by an ad rate, or the percentage of an item's total sale amount (including item price shipping, taxes, and any other applicable fees) that is charged when a buyer clicks on and then purchases any of your items promoted using a general strategy within 30 days.\nYes. You can promote the same listings through general and priority campaigns. Listings can simultaneously be in multiple priority campaigns but can only ever be in one general campaign at a time.\nWe use a last click attribution model, meaning that the sale will be attributed to the click closest to the time of sale. Last click attribution ensures that a sale is only attributed once across Promoted Listings campaigns.\nIf a buyer clicks on a general ad and then purchases any of your promoted items within 30 days, it will be considered a promoted sale and the ad fee for the purchased item will be charged.\nYou will always be charged for valid clicks on listings promoted using a priority strategy, but you will only be charged for listings promoted using the general strategy if a buyer clicks on your ad and then purchases any of your promoted items within 30 days of clicking.\nFor priority ads, a sale will be attributed to and reported as a sale if the buyer clicks on one of your priority ads and then purchases that item, also known as a Direct Sale.\nIn the event of multiple priority ad clicks, the sale will be attributed to the ad that was clicked closest to the sale.\nUnlike general ads, priority ads will continue to report Direct Sales only.\nIt is possible to see a sale attributed and reported as both a general and priority sale if you have the same items promoted using both campaign strategies.\nPriority ads will incur a charge each time they are clicked, regardless of whether that item sells. No changes have been made to how priority fees work.\nYou can see which listings sold through each campaign by looking at the reports in your priority and general campaigns.\nThe priority strategy uses a cost-per-click model, and you will always be charged for valid clicks on these ads, but you will only be charged for listings promoted using the general strategy if a buyer clicks on a general ad and then purchases any of your items promoted with a general strategy items within 30 days of a click on one of your general ads.\nFor listings promoted using a general strategy, if a buyer clicks on a general ad and then purchases any of your general strategy items within 30 days, it will be considered a promoted sale and an ad fee will be charged.\nIf the item purchased is the same as the item featured in the general ad the buyer clicked on, we will charge the ad fee in effect at the time of the click. This type of sale is known as a Direct Sale.\nIf the item purchased is different from the item featured in the general ad the buyer clicked on, we will charge the ad fee for the purchased item in effect at the time of the sale. This type of sale is known as a Halo Item sale. The ad fee for a Halo Item sale will be calculated based on the ad rate in effect for the purchased item at the time of the sale.\nIf you have listings promoted via both the general and priority strategy, you will be charged for Attributed Sales from general clicks even if your ad received a subsequent priority click. Reporting will be updated accordingly to include sales for both campaign strategies."

Learn more about what we offer on our Promoted Listings overview page\nThe priority strategy helps your listings reach highly motivated buyers with priority access to ad placements and advanced targeting. With precise control over your ad spend, you can effectively target your ads while paying only for clicks on your ads.\nFor each campaign using the priority strategy you run, you'll be charged for the clicks on your ads up to the amount determined by your campaign's target daily budget. The target daily budget is the average daily amount you'd like your campaign to spend throughout a week. The amount you pay per week won't exceed seven times your target daily budget, unless you set or change your target mid-week. Changes made to your target daily budget midweek can impact your campaign's maximum weekly spend. Once seven times your daily budget has been reached within a given week, your campaign will stop showing ads until the weekly target daily budget period resets on the following Sunday.\nAbove Standard or Top Rated sellers with enough account activity can promote fixed price listings for most categories.\nThe following are not eligible for priority campaigns:\nAuction listings and Auction listings with Buy It Now\nListings in Wholesale & Job Lots, Cars, Motorcycles & Vehicles, Events Tickets, Property, E-Cigarettes, Vapes & Accs or Everything Else categories\nListings that are out of stock\nUsing the priority campaign strategy\nYou can promote your listings with the priority strategy from the Advertising dashboard, Active Listings, and through the advanced listing tool.

When promoting your listings with a priority campaign strategy, you'll choose from one of two targeting strategies: Smart targeting or Manual targeting.\nSmart targeting\nSmart targeting enables easy setup when you promote your listings with a priority strategy. You'll determine how much you pay each day and we'll automatically target your ads. Your campaign will automatically update over time to optimize your ads. Here's how to get started:\nNavigate to the Seller Hub, click on the Advertising tab.\nSelect Create new campaign .\nChoose Promote your listings from the available ad type options.\nSelect a Priority campaign strategy.\nAdd listings to your campaign.\nSelect Smart targeting to automatically target your ads to buyers.\nSet a target daily budget for your campaign and, if you would like, you can set a maximum cost-per-click (CPC).\nEnter a Campaign name and set your Start date and End date .\nLaunch your campaign.\nWhen you set up a priority campaign with smart targeting, you can edit your campaign's maximum cost-per-click (maximum CPC). This setting determines the highest amount you are willing to pay for each click on an ad. The amount you pay for each click will be up to - but never more than - any maximum CPC you set.\nThe maximum CPC you choose is essentially your bid in an auction that determines ad placement. Leaving the maximum CPC blank, or setting a higher maximum CPC, increases the likelihood that your ad will win the auction and appear in a prominent position. This means that your listing is more likely to be shown and clicked on by potential buyers. Conversely, a lower maximum CPC might save you money per click but could result in your ad being shown less frequently, potentially leading to fewer overall sales.\nTip Using smart targeting can help you save time while reaching your advertising goals.\nManual targeting\nManual targeting gives you advanced control with keyword targeting and bids, so you can determine how much each click on one of your ads is worth to you. You'll select how to manage ongoing optimizations to help your campaigns remain competitive. Here's how to get started:\nNavigate to the Seller Hub, click on the Advertising tab.\nSelect Create new campaign .\nChoose Promote your listings from the available ad type options.\nSelect a Priority campaign strategy.\nAdd listings to your campaign.\nSelect Manual targeting to use keywords to target your ads.\nChoose your bidding strategy: Dynamic bidding strategy or a Fixed bidding strategy .\nReview or manually edit your ad groups, keyword targeting, and keyword bids.\nSet a target daily budget for your campaign.\nEnter a Campaign name and set your Start date and End date .\nLaunch your campaign.\nAd groups\nAd groups help you build more effective manual targeting campaigns by organizing your listings and keywords into a common goal or category. Grouping together similar listings allows you to target them with the same set of keywords.\nCampaigns can have up to 500 ad groups and up to 1,000 listings in each ad group.\nIf you're creating an ad group containing inventory that you would like to promote for Father's Day:\nCampaign: Father's Day Target daily budget: $500 Ad group: Best selling men's sneakers Listings: High top sneakers, Running shoes Keywords: Men's athletic shoes, high tops, best running shoes, popular men's sneakers Ad group: Last season's men's athletic wear Listings: Joggers, Sweatshirts, Shirts Keywords: Fleece hooded sweatshirts, athleisure, quick dry t-shirt, high waisted jogger pants\nTarget daily budget: $500 Ad group: Best selling men's sneakers Listings: High top sneakers, Running shoes Keywords: Men's athletic shoes, high tops, best running shoes, popular men's sneakers Ad group: Last season's men's athletic wear Listings: Joggers, Sweatshirts, Shirts Keywords: Fleece hooded sweatshirts, athleisure, quick dry t-shirt, high waisted jogger pants\nAd group: Best selling men's sneakers\nListings: High top sneakers, Running shoes\nKeywords: Men's athletic shoes, high tops, best running shoes, popular men's sneakers\nAd group: Last season's men's athletic wear\nListings: Joggers, Sweatshirts, Shirts\nKeywords: Fleece hooded sweatshirts, athleisure, quick dry t-shirt, high waisted jogger pants\nTip We recommend 10-15 keywords per unique product type.\nKeywords\nKeywords are words or phrases used to target buyers with your priority ads using manual targeting. Use relevant keywords and add relevant search terms as keywords to help improve the visibility of your ads. Suggested keywords can help you identify queries buyers are using to look for items like yours.\nYou can also use negative keywords to prevent your ads from being matched to shopping journeys that include your negative keywords. Meaning, when a buyer searches for a term that you've added as a negative keyword, your ads will not be eligible for display. You'll never be charged for negative keywords.\nYou can use up to 1,000 targeted keywords per ad group. Additionally, you can add up to 1,000 negative keywords per ad group.\nKeyword match types\nMatch types determine how closely a buyer's query must match the meaning of your keyword in order for your ad to appear.\nBroad match matches your ads to keywords based on how related they appear to buyers' shopping journeys.\nBroad match can help you reach a wider audience with fewer keywords. For example, if you add the keyword \"kid's shoes\" with broad match to your campaign, your ads could show for search queries like \"children's footwear\".\nOne of your keywords is outdoor lights\nYour ad may appear for: Outdoor solar lights Lawn lights Solar lights for garden\nOutdoor solar lights\nLawn lights\nSolar lights for garden\nYour ad will not appear for: Outdoor heater Outdoor grill\nOutdoor heater\nOutdoor grill\nPhrase match allows your listings to appear when a buyer's query or shopping journey matches your keyword's meaning and may include other words before or after your keyword.\nOne of your keywords is outdoor lights\nYour ad may appear for: Outside light Exterior lamp Yard lights Lights for outside\nOutside light\nExterior lamp\nYard lights\nLights for outside\nYour ad will not appear for: Outdoor LED lights Philips outside lamps\nOutdoor LED lights\nPhilips outside lamps\nExact match allows your listings to appear when a buyer's shopping journey closely matches the meaning of your keyword.\nOne of your keywords is outdoor lights\nYour ad may appear for: Outside light Exterior lamp Yard lights Lights for outdoor\nOutside light\nExterior lamp\nYard lights\nLights for outdoor\nYour ad will not appear for: Outdoor LED lights Philips Outside lamps\nOutdoor LED lights\nPhilips Outside lamps\nNegative keywords\nNegative exact match keywords are terms which are excluded from your ad group. Meaning, when a buyer searches for a term that you've added as a negative keyword, your Advanced ads will not be eligible for display.\nNegative keywords are exact match without variants, meaning that for a keyword to be excluded, it needs to match the buyer's search term character-for-character.\nOne of your negative match keywords is yellow socks.\nYour ad will only be excluded from buyers using that exact search term\nNegative phrase match keywords will exclude your item from appearing for search terms that include your exact keyword and may include other words before and/or after your keyword, but not between\nOne of your negative phrase match keywords is yellow socks:\nYour ad will only be excluded from buyers using that exact search term, plus any search term that includes \"yellow socks\" with other terms either before or after the keyword\ne.g. \"large yellow socks\" or yellow socks womens\"\nBidding strategy\nA campaign bidding strategy is the option you can select to determine how your keyword bids are managed throughout the duration of your campaign. There are two campaign bidding strategies you can choose from: fixed and dynamic.\nA dynamic bidding strategy will automatically update keyword bids daily to the suggested bid. With this strategy, sellers do not need to make daily, manual updates to keep their keyword bids competitive in the marketplace.\nSuggested bids are calculated using factors that may include item attributes, seasonality, available performance data, keyword match types, and competition, along with market dynamics, to help you find the optimal balance between performance and cost for each individual ad group.\nA fixed bidding strategy will not change once it's been set. You can review your performance and update your campaign bidding strategy at any time.\nPriority ad fees\nPriority ad fees are based on your bid, the level of competition for queries in which your ad appears, and the clicks your ads have received.\nFor each campaign, the amount you pay per week won't exceed seven times your target daily budget, unless you set or change your target mid-week. Once seven times your daily budget has been reached within a given week, your campaign will stop showing ads until the weekly target daily budget period resets on Sunday.\nHere's how priority ad fees work:\nThe amount that you will be charged for each click is based on a second-price auction\nAll priority ad fees are charged at a listing level. Charges are determined by the sum of all cost-per-click clicks a single listing receives within a day\nWhen you promote your listings with the priority strategy there are two ways to bid: manual targeting and smart targeting. With manual targeting, you select a keyword bid for each keyword and keyword match type combination. With smart targeting, your bids will automatically be applied for you subject to a maximum CPC you set\nBecause the listings, keywords and bids in each second price auction are unique, each cost-per-click calculation is dynamic\nSales of promoted and non-promoted items will be attributed within a 30-day window of a click on your ad\nWhile it is possible to be charged for multiple legitimate clicks from the same buyer, we have checks in place to filter out invalid clicks. If clicks on an ad are identified as invalid, you will not be charged. Note that you will also be charged if you click on your own priority ad.\nViewing your fees\nFees for your promoted listings campaigns using the priority campaign strategy will appear as \"Promoted Listings - Priority fees\" in your Payments tab or on your seller invoice\nWe combine all clicks a seller receives on a priority ad in a given campaign on a daily basis and sellers are generally charged for these clicks up to 72 hours after the clicks take place\nYour charges are reported at a listing level. From your Payments tab or invoice, you'll see the campaign ID, click date, total number of clicks, and average cost-per-click per listing\nThe target daily budget is the average daily amount you'd like your campaign to spend throughout the week.\nThe amount you pay per week won't exceed seven times your set target daily budget, unless you set or change it mid-week. Changes made to your target daily budget midweek can impact your campaign's maximum weekly spend. For your campaign's target daily budget, the calendar week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.\nOn any given day you could spend less than your target daily budget, or up to double the highest target daily budget in effect on that day. You can set and edit your target daily budget at any time during the week.\nOnce your campaign has met your target daily budget multiplied by the days remaining in the week at the time that budget went into effect, your campaign will stop showing ads until the target daily budget window resets on Sunday. Listings in a campaign will be eligible to begin surfacing again if you increase the target daily budget of an out-of-budget campaign.\nHow changes to your target daily budget affect your campaign's total weekly spend\nOn days when you change the target daily budget, the daily spending limit is double the most recent target daily budget for that day, unless you've already spent equal to or more than that amount. If you decrease your daily budget and your total ad spend for that day is below your new budget, your new budget may start to be used on that day. However, if your daily campaign spend exceeds your new budget, your new budget will come into effect on the following day.\nFor example, if you decrease your target daily budget from $50 to $30 at noon, but your campaign has already spent $80 that day, then you will be charged $80 for that day and your ads will stop showing until the target daily budget resets the following day. There is a $1 minimum and a $1,000,000 maximum daily budget\nTarget daily budget is increased midweek:\nAt the beginning of the week, the campaign had a target daily budget of $30, which if maintained throughout the week would add up to a maximum campaign spend of $210 ($30 x 7 days). On Sunday, the campaign spent exactly $30. However on Monday, this campaign spends $40 to leverage high traffic on relevant buyer journeys. On Tuesday, your campaign returns to the original target daily budget of $30, bringing the total spent for Sunday through Tuesday to $100.\nAfter evaluating the campaign's performance, the target daily budget is increased to $50 on Wednesday. This adjustment raised the maximum spend for the rest of the week to $200 ($50 * 4 remaining days, including Wednesday), in addition to the $100 already spent. Your campaign allocates the budget over the remaining days, leading to $125 in ad spend for Wednesday through Saturday. Over the course of the week, your campaign's total spend is $225.\nOn Sunday the campaign's weekly spending limit will reset and the following week will use the revised target daily budget of $50, which if maintained throughout the week would add up to a maximum campaign spend of $350 ($50 * 7 days).\nTarget daily budget is decreased midweek:\nAt the beginning of the week, the campaign had a target daily budget of $30, which if maintained throughout the week would add up to a maximum campaign spend of $210 ($30 x 7 days). On Sunday, the campaign spent exactly $30. However on Monday, this campaign spends $40 to leverage high traffic on relevant buyer journeys. On Tuesday, your campaign returns to the original target daily budget of $30, bringing the total spent for Sunday through Tuesday to $100.\nUpon reviewing the campaign’s performance, the target daily budget was decreased to $20 on Wednesday. Prior to this budget change, the campaign had been operating with the previous budget and already spent $50 that day. This means that the new, reduced budget will be implemented the following day and the maximum spend for the rest of the week to $60 ($30 * 3 remaining days, excluding Wednesday).\nFor the rest of the week, the campaign utilized the new budget, allocating $60 total across Thursday through Saturday. The campaign’s total maximum spend for the week was $210, which includes the $100 spent from Sunday to Tuesday, the $50 spent on Wednesday, and the $60 allocated from Thursday to Saturday. On Sunday the campaign’s weekly spending limit will reset and the following week will use the revised target daily budget of $20, which if maintained throughout the week would add up to a maximum campaign spend of $140 ($20 * 7 days).\nMultiple target daily budget changes in a week:\nAt the beginning of the week, the campaign had a target daily budget of $30, which if maintained throughout the week would add up to a maximum campaign spend of $210 ($30 x 7 days). On Sunday, the campaign spent exactly $30. However on Monday, this campaign spends $40 to leverage high traffic on relevant buyer journeys. On Tuesday, your campaign returns to the original target daily budget of $30, bringing the total spent for Sunday through Tuesday to $100.\nAfter evaluating the campaign’s performance, the target daily budget is increased to $50 on Wednesday. This adjustment raised the maximum spend for the rest of the week to $200 ($50 * 4 remaining days, including Wednesday), in addition to the $100 already spent. The campaign spends $80, which is above the target daily budget on Wednesday, to capitalize on relevant traffic.\nOn Thursday, the campaign spent $35 and it was decided to reduce the daily budget back to $30. The change decreases the maximum spend for the final two days of the week to $60 ($30 * two remaining days, excluding Thursday). The campaign uses the adjusted budget for the remainder of the week with a total spend for Thursday and Friday of $55.\nThe campaign’s spend for the week is $270 ($100 Sunday to Tuesday, $80 on Wednesday, $35 on Thursday, and $55 on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday the campaign’s weekly spending limit will reset and the following week will use the revised target daily budget of $30,  which if maintained throughout the week would add up to a maximum campaign spend of $210 ($30 * 7 days).\nMonitoring your campaigns\nAdvertising and Campaign dashboards\nOnce you have activated a campaign, you can view the performance of all of your Promoted Listings campaigns from the Advertising dashboard - opens in new window or tab .\nYour Campaign dashboard lets you see detailed ad group-level, keyword-level, and listing-level reporting for each individual campaign.

The more competitive the bid, the more likely your listing appears in an eligible ad slot.\nPriority campaigns offer two ways to bid: manual targeting and smart targeting. With manual targeting, you select the bid amount. With smart targeting, eBay will bid for you subject to a maximum CPC you set.\nThe cost for each click is based on a second price auction, which means the fee charged is determined by factors like listing quality, keyword relevance, your bid amount, competition from other sellers, and a reserve price. The reserve price is the minimum amount we've determined a click is worth, taking item quality, competition, seasonality, and marketplace thresholds into consideration.\nCampaign management FAQs\nYou cannot change your priority campaign's targeting strategy from smart targeting to manual targeting, and vice versa, after your campaign has launched.\nWhen adding listings to your campaign, you have a few options depending on which targeting strategy you're using. All campaigns can use manual listing selection and bulk listing selection. Priority campaigns using smart targeting can use manual, bulk, and rule-based listing selection.\nWith manual listing selection, you select individual listings and have the flexibility to adjust your campaign as needed. Manual listings selection is recommended for sellers looking for the most control over their listing selection.\nBulk listing selection is an efficient way to create and manage large campaigns by copying and pasting a list of item IDs. Bulk listing selection is recommended for sellers with large inventories.\nUse rule-based listing selection to automate listing selection and save time managing your priority campaigns using smart targeting. You can use brand, category, price, and condition filters to define a rule that will add current and future listings to your campaign. Rule-based listing selection is recommended for sellers with dynamic inventory and who wish to minimize their campaign management time.\nFor example, a rule you create could add all men's shoes and women's shoes from any brand, priced between $60-$100 and whose condition is new to your campaign. As listings are added to your campaign, eBay will use smart targeting to optimize your campaign bidding and targeting.\nRecommended listings are those that have the most potential to drive sales based on eBay's historical data.\nSuggested keywords are search terms that we've determined are relevant and likely to perform well in your ad group.\nWe evaluate keywords based on how frequently they've been used in recent searches and how relevant those searches are to the listings in your ad group. These keyword suggestions are designed to help you target buyers who are actively looking for items like yours.\nYou can monitor your keyword performance on your Campaign dashboard or by downloading keyword-level reports for each campaign. Remove any low-performing keywords and replace them with new suggested keywords to further optimize your campaign.\nSuggested bids are calculated using a variety of factors that may include item attributes, seasonality, past performance data, keyword match types, and competition, along with campaign performance and market dynamics, to help you find the optimal balance between performance and cost for each individual ad group.\nAfter launch, suggested bids may adapt to updates you make to your ad groups, your campaign’s performance, and market conditions. Use dynamic bidding to help keep your campaign bids automatically competitive. If you’re using fixed bidding, check back regularly to ensure your campaign stays competitive.\nThere is a $0.02 minimum and $100 maximum bid for keywords.\nWe don't restrict trademarked terms as keywords. If a listing isn't relevant for a particular branded query, however, the priority ad for that listing is not likely to show. Our algorithms are designed with proprietary relevance and performance filters in place, which means that ads will only appear if they pass our relevancy filters and will only continue to show if buyers actually engage with them.\nIf you believe that any content in which you claim trademark ownership has been infringed by anyone using eBay's services, please notify our VeRO team through the Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program and eBay will investigate your notice.\nReporting and billing FAQs\nYour campaign’s target daily budget is averaged over the course of a week to help your campaign dynamically react to relevant traffic. On any given day you could spend less than your target daily budget, or up to double the highest target daily budget in effect on that day. You can set and edit your target daily budget at any time during the week.\nFor example, if your campaign had a target daily budget of $30 your campaign could spend up to $60 on any given day, however you wouldn’t be charged more than $210 for this campaign over the course of the week. For your campaign’s target daily budget, the calendar week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday.\nNote: Depending on your country, the corresponding VAT rate can be applied to your advertising fees. Unless you registered as a business account and provided your tax registration details, we'll add VAT to your advertising fees\nNote: If your registered address is in Australia, Australian GST is payable on your advertising fees. Unless you registered as a business account and provided your tax registration details, we'll add GST to your advertising fees\nA number of factors can cause changes in your campaigns' visibility, clicks or sales, including buyer traffic or demand, seasonality, changes to the competitive landscape, general platform changes, and more.\nSelecting the right keywords and setting competitive bids on keywords is crucial (to help optimize campaigns, we provide you with suggested bids and bid ranges for all suggested keywords). Improving the quality of your listings may also increase the chances of your ads performing well.\nYou should also keep an eye on your campaign performance to ensure your ad groups remain effective. Suggested keywords and bids can change over time, so we suggest monitoring your campaign performance and making any needed changes to remain competitive"

If you only want to ship with eBay International Shipping, you may need to manually update your listings to remove the international self-shipping options. For more information on how to update your listings, see our Seller Center - opens in new window or tab page.\nWe'll let you know when an item sells to an international buyer and provide you with the domestic shipping hub address. All you need to do is send your sold items to the domestic shipping hub before the estimated delivery date, and the international shipping and customs process will be managed for you.\nBenefits of eBay International Shipping\nAs well as making your items available to buyers in almost 200 countries, there are several other benefits to using eBay International Shipping:\nWhen you ship internationally using eBay International Shipping, you're responsible for sending the item your buyer purchased safely to the US shipping hub. If a buyer reports that an item was lost or damaged during international shipping or it is damaged at the hub, we'll work with the buyer to resolve the issue.

Read our full list of seller terms and conditions to find out more about eBay International Shipping eligibility and program requirements.\nShipping and tracking your items\nWhen shipping your item to the domestic shipping hub, always add tracking details and include the reference number on the label to ensure it arrives safely. This is done automatically for you if you create the shipping label on eBay . The domestic shipping hubs are in multiple locations so you may see different addresses on your labels.\nOnce your item is received at the domestic shipping hub, international tracking will be added so that you and your buyer can track the item's progress.\nIf you'd like to purchase shipping insurance for your item, you'll only need to insure the package for the journey to the domestic hub. If the item is lost during international delivery, we'll refund your buyer and you'll still keep the sale.\nCombined shipping\nIf a buyer purchases multiple items from you, the order will automatically be combined if it's eligible for combined shipping. There are several reasons why shipping can't be combined when sending items through eBay International Shipping. For example, combined shipping won’t be applied if:\nThe order costs more than $1000 USD\nThe listing is in auction-style format\nThe items exceed the program’s package limits\nIf the buyer is paying import charges at checkout for some items and paying import charges on delivery for other items in the same order, the shipping won’t be combined.\nTip Each eBay International Shipping order should fit in one package which meets the weight and dimensions allowed.\nShipping exclusions\nYou can manage your shipping exclusions through your Shipping Preferences - opens in new window or tab , Business Policies, or by revising your listings.\nYou can apply your exclusions to items shipping with eBay International Shipping by updating your settings at any time.

All eBay International Shipping returns will be processed on your behalf.\nWhen a buyer opens a return, we'll refund your buyer and you'll keep the sale. When the return is received at the eBay International Shipping inspection hub, it will be inspected to make sure it's in the same condition. We'll then issue the refund to the buyer's original payment method, usually within 5 to 7 business days of the item being received at the hub. Returned items and items that couldn't be delivered to the buyer may not be returned to you.\nIf you receive negative or neutral feedback related to item handling during international shipping, we'll remove it.\nFees and charges\nThere's no extra charge to ship your items with eBay International Shipping and you won't be charged an international fee. To find out what fees and selling costs may apply to you, see our article on selling fees .\nThe buyer will be charged any US domestic shipping and handling costs that you specified, as well as international shipping, and other fees as determined by eBay.

        "content": "Help webpage title: eBay Seller Capital \nHelp webpage description: If you're a business seller, you may be eligible to receive funding through eBay Seller Capital financing partners to help you grow and run your business. \nHelp webpage content: eBay Seller Capital financing can be used to help your business in a variety of ways, such as buying new inventory, investing in marketing initiatives, renting a retail space, or hiring staff.\nHow it works\neBay works with financing partners Funding Circle and Liberis to provide eligible eBay sellers with financing. Through the eBay Seller Capital program, these providers, not eBay, can provide you with financing.\nA number of financing options may be available to you, including term loans, Business Cash Advances and Flexible Cash Advances. If your application is approved, financing up to $10 million may be available to you. The amount you're offered will depend on your business performance, business tenure and sales history. If your application is successful, the funds will be deposited into your business bank account.\nApplying for funding\nIf you're pre-approved for financing by any of our finance partners, you may receive a personalized offer to apply for funding. You may receive an email or be able to view your personalized offers on the eBay Seller Capital page on Seller Hub. You can also check your eligibility for the available financing products on the eBay Seller Capital - opens in new window or tab information page.\nAs part of your application, you'll be asked to verify your identity, and provide personal and/or business information. You'll also need to confirm the bank account where you would like to receive your loan or cash advance payments, if approved. Depending on the provider, you may be asked to provide bank statements or tax returns to verify your income.\nTip If you have any questions about the details of your financing, or if you need to change any of your information, contact your provider directly. To contact Funding Circle, email loanquestions@fundingcircle.com or call +1 (866) 679-7966. To contact Liberis, email info-us@liberis.com or call +1 (470) 582-1130.\nTerm loans\nA term loan is a lump sum of money that you receive through eBay Seller Capital partners in return for a fixed borrowing cost.\nThere are several reasons why you might choose a term loan, including:\nYou'll generally have a longer time to pay back the loan, resulting in smaller repayments each time\nInterest rates tend to be lower than for short-term business loans\nFixed repayments on a fixed schedule make it easier for you to plan and budget\nThe interest on a term loan may be tax deductible and making repayments on time can boost your business credit score\nYou won't need to hand over business equity in exchange for capital. Our lending partners will have no control over your business\nBusiness Cash Advances\nA Business Cash Advance is an advance on your sales. If approved, you'll have access to a lump sum of capital upfront. This is not a loan — the cost comes in the form of a fixed fee, not interest. Also, unlike a term loan that has fixed monthly payments, a Business Cash Advance is paid on a pre-agreed percentage of your gross sales.\nThere are several reasons why you might choose a Business Cash Advance, including:\nThe fast application process means approval and funding can take less than 24 hours in most cases\nPayments are calculated as a percentage of your daily gross eBay sales. Your gross daily sales includes any taxes, shipping costs and any other fees associated with your orders. This generally makes Business Cash Advances accessible to startups and young businesses\nIf your business doesn't generate any sales, you'll have no payments to make\nTip For FAQs and more information about how this program works, take a look at our eBay Seller Capital - opens in new window or tab website.\nFlexible Cash Advances\nA Flexible Cash Advance gives you access to an account that contains your available capital. This is the maximum amount of money you can access at any one time.\nWhen you'd like a new advance, simply go to your account dashboard and request one. Your available capital will refresh as payments are made towards any outstanding balance.\nThere are several reasons you might choose a Flexible Cash Advance, including:\nIt's free to set up your account with available capital, and there's no commitment to use it\nYou only pay a fee when you request a new advance. The fee is a set price that doesn't increase over time\nIt's powered by your daily eBay gross sales. You don't pay for the total available capital, only for each new advance you take from it\nLike the Business Cash Advance, each advance under the Flexible Cash Advance program is an advance on your sales, not a loan. The cost comes in the form of a fixed fee, not interest, and payments are calculated as a percentage of your daily gross sales on eBay. Your gross daily sales includes any taxes, shipping costs and any other fees associated with your orders. Your available capital is usually accessible for 12 months from the date your Flexible Cash Advance account started.\nPayments and repayments\nYour loan repayments or cash advance payments, including when they will need to be made, depend on the type of financing you receive. The full details can be found in your financing agreement.\nTerm loans\nIf approved, the term loan amount will be deposited into your business bank account, and then you'll pay back a fixed repayment amount at a regular cadence (usually monthly) until the total payment amount is repaid.\nBusiness Cash Advance and Flexible Cash Advance payments\nIf you receive a Business Cash Advance or Flexible Cash Advance, a fixed percentage of your daily gross sales on eBay will be paid out, instead of fixed monthly payments. Your gross daily sales include taxes, shipping costs and any other fees associated with your orders.\nWhenever you sell an item, payments from each completed order are credited to your available funds.\nWe calculate the daily payment for the Business Cash Advance using the payment percentage we received from the financier. We'll then deduct payments from your available funds each day before sending payouts. Don't worry – we'll never deduct more than what you have available, regardless of your calculated payment amount.\nYour payment is then automatically transferred to the financing partner from a Limited Use Stored Value Account - opens in new window or tab . It usually takes less than 2 business days to complete this transfer.\nSee the table below for an example of Business Cash Advance or Flexible Cash Advance payments. The example shown is for a seller with an active Business Cash Advance of $20,000 and based on a daily payment percentage of 20%.\nDay\nDaily gross sales\nPayment amount\nOutstanding financing balance\nViewing your financing details on eBay\nIf you've received a Business Cash Advance or Flexible Cash Advance, you can view your payment details at any time in Seller Hub, My eBay or on the eBay app. You can also find more details about the financing offers that may be available if you are eligible, pre-qualified or pre-approved. Here's how:\nOn the eBay app:\nOpen the app and select My eBay from the menu.\nTap Payments .\nTap eBay Seller Capital .\nIn Seller Hub:\nSelect the Payments tab.\nSelect Seller Capital on the left-hand side.\nIn My eBay:\nSelect Account .\nSelect Payments .\nSelect eBay Seller Capital .\nYou can also go to your account settings - opens in new window or tab on desktop and select eBay Seller Capital under Selling.\nTroubleshooting payments issues\nIf a Business Cash Advance or Flexible Cash Advance payment didn't process, there are a few reasons why this may have happened:\nNo sales – If you haven't made any sales on a particular day, we won't remit any payments for that day\nNegative account balance – If the balance in your Total funds or Available funds is negative, your payouts and financing payments will be blocked. If this is due to a transaction hold, your payouts and payments will resume once the holds are released. See our Payments on hold help page for more information\nPayment dispute or Payout holds – If you have a Payment dispute hold or Payout hold related to registration, compliance or tax, your payments may be canceled.

Our authenticators are experts with specialist knowledge of their respective product categories.\nOnce they receive the item, the authenticators verify that the contents of the package are consistent with the seller's listing. They then perform a thorough, multi-step, physical inspection for authenticity. Any packaging and accessories included in the purchase are also reviewed for authenticity. Inspections are generally completed within 2 business days.\nIf the item passes inspection, it's repackaged and shipped on to you with 2-day secure delivery, or in the case of trading cards, 4-day secure delivery. The authenticated item is accompanied by a card or tag that confirms it has been verified by the authenticator.\nFees and costs for Authenticity Guarantee\nFor most categories, eBay covers the costs of the Authenticity Guarantee service, including both the expert inspection and shipping from the authentication facility to you.\nIn some categories, you'll see Authenticity Guarantee available as an add-on option for lower-priced items.

If we send the item on to you, we'll clearly indicate if there's any part of it that wasn't able to be authenticated.\nIf an issue is found during inspection\nIf the authenticity of an item can't be verified, or the item's condition is not consistent with the listing, it won't be sent on to you and you'll get your money back.\nSometimes, an item passes our authenticity checks but there's a minor discrepancy with its listing. For example, the item is not in its original packaging, there's a minor mark that wasn't mentioned in the listing, or it's missing an accessory that was part of the listing.\nIf this happens, we'll get in touch with you. We'll let you know the details, provide any relevant pictures, and ask you to confirm whether you'd still like to go ahead with the purchase.\nIf you choose to go ahead, we'll send it on to you as an authenticated item.

This generally means you can return it even if the seller doesn't accept returns, for example if the item was damaged during shipping. However, some items are considered \" final sale \" and have limited coverage under eBay Money Back Guarantee.\nWhen you're returning an item, we'll give you a return shipping label to send it back to the authenticator. They'll check that the item is still in the same condition and has all relevant accessories. Once the item has been re-inspected, you'll receive a full refund and the item will be returned to the seller. If the authenticator determines the returned item is not the same item that was originally authenticated, or is not in the same condition as when it was authenticated, the item will be sent back to you and you won't receive a refund.

This service is currently offered for some luxury items, where you'll see the option to talk to a specialist on the listing page."
