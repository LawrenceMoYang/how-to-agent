You are provided with the following content:

`{{text}}`

Your task is to generate a list of up to 5 potential user questions and their corresponding answers based on the content. Follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure all questions and answers are derived strictly from the provided content and do not introduce information that is not explicitly present in the content.
2. Ensure the questions cover a range of topics present in the content.
3. Include questions with varying levels of complexity, from simple to more detailed.
4. Make the questions relevant to the main purpose or subject of the content.
5. Phrase the questions as direct queries that a user might naturally ask.
6. Do not number the questions or include an index before them.
7. Focus on creating reasonable, specific questions that a seller might ask if applicable.
8. If the content does not support generating 5 questions, produce fewer instead.
9. Provide answers that are directly and accurately derived from the provided content.

### Output Format:
Your answers should be in JSON format only, following this structure:

[
    {
        "question": "Example question?",
        "answer": "Example answer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Another question?",
        "answer": "Another answer."
    }
]

Do not include any explanations, code fences, or additional text before or after the JSON data.
