You are tasked with generating diverse variants of a given question to simulate how different users might ask it.

### Instructions:
1. Ensure all variants preserve the original meaning of the question.
2. Use the following techniques for diversity:
   - **Synonym Substitution**: Replace words with synonyms or similar expressions.
   - **Sentence Structure Change**: Reorganize the sentence while retaining its meaning.
   - **Question Type Variation**: Alter the question format (e.g., interrogative, declarative).
   - **Informal Language**: Add typos, slang, or casual phrasing.
3. Return exactly 5 distinct variants of the given question.
4. Output the results in a structured JSON format.

### Input:
`{{text}}`

### Output Format:
Your answers should be in JSON format only, following this structure:

{
    "original_question": "{{test}}",
    "variants": [
        "<First variant>",
        "<Second variant>",
        "<Third variant>",
        "<Fourth variant>",
        "<Fifth variant>"
    ]
}

Do not include any explanations, code fences, or additional text before or after the JSON data.
